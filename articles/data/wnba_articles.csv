0,Seimone Augustus,"Seimone Augustus, Vince Carter, Chauncey Billups among Basketball Hall of Fame finalists for 2024",https://www.wbrz.com/news/seimone-augustus-vince-carter-chauncey-billups-among-basketball-hall-of-fame-finalists-for-2024,"INDIANAPOLIS (AP) — Vince Carter is one step from the Basketball Hall of Fame. Carter — who played 22 NBA seasons, the most in league history — was among the Hall of Fame finalists announced Friday at All-Star weekend. The finalist nod came in Carter’s first year of eligibility. Also among the finalists: four-time WNBA champion Seimone Augustus, former Detroit Pistons guard and current Portland Trail Blazers coach Chauncey Billups, former Los Angeles Lakers guard Michael Cooper, Phoenix Suns all-time leading scorer Walter Davis, former Wisconsin coach Bo Ryan, and three nominees as contributors — former player and coach Doug Collins, Indiana Pacers owner Herb Simon and NBA legend Jerry West, who was enshrined as a player in 1980. “Every year is new. Every year is different. We’re very happy with this group,” said Jerry Colangelo, Chairman of the Basketball Hall of Fame. “And hopefully, we’re going to have great results in terms of voting.” That voting takes place in the coming weeks, with the Class of 2024 set to be unveiled at the Final Four in Phoenix on April 6. The class will be enshrined on Aug. 17 in Springfield, Massachusetts. “Unbelievable,” Carter said. “You look in the crowd, you see Hall of Famers, and the opportunity … I mean, you can’t beat that. You can’t beat that. It’s a proud moment.” Other finalists include Charles Smith, the winningest high school head coach in Louisiana history; former Kansas coach Marian Washington; Australian guard Michele Timms; three-time NAIA champion at Tennessee A&I Dick Barnett; and six-time AAU champion coach Harley Redin. Washington, Redin and Timms are all already in the Women’s Basketball Hall of Fame. Timms is also a member of the FIBA Hall of Fame. Colangelo said he was pleased to see diversity within the group of finalists — men, women, big-name players and small-college coaches among them. “It’s an honor that reflects not only individual greatness but also the long-lasting impact on the game itself,” Colangelo said of being a finalist. “From the strategic brilliance of coaches to the unmatched abilities of players and the influential roles of a coach-broadcaster, an esteemed owner, and a dynasty-building executive, each finalist embodies the pinnacle of basketball excellence.” Nominees were announced in December. Among those who did not make the cut this year — Penny Hardaway, and the 2008 U.S. Olympic Team dubbed the “Redeem Team” after winning gold in Beijing four years after the Americans finished third at the Athens Games. There were other honorees revealed by the Hall on Friday as well. JoAn Scott, the NCAA’s vice president of men’s basketball, received the John Bunn Lifetime Achievement Award. She has been with the NCAA since 2013 after time at Nike and USA Basketball – where, among other duties, she was the staff administrator for the original Dream Team at the 1992 Barcelona Olympics. Also announced Friday were the recipients of this year’s Curt Gowdy Awards, named for the legendary broadcaster and given to those deemed to have made “a significant contribution to the game of basketball.” J.A. Adande, the director of sports journalism at his alma mater Northwestern, received the Curt Gowdy Award for print journalism. Longtime analyst and television commentator Debbie Antonelli won for electronic journalism. Slam Magazine and the television show “NBA Inside Stuff” received the awards for transformative media. They will also be honored during Hall of Fame weekend.",2024-02-17T05:00:00Z
1,Ashley Battle,Former Newcastle owner Mike Ashley to sue club in £1.5million legal battle,https://talksport.com/football/1799197/newcastle-mike-ashley-adidas-saudi-pif/,"Former Newcastle owner Mike Ashley will take the club to court for refusing to supply next season's kits for sale at his Sports Direct chain. A claim lodged at the Competition Appeal Tribunal has revealed that Ashley will sue his former side for ‘abusing its dominant position in the market’ by not supplying 50,900 units of Newcastle merchandise. The order, made up mainly of shirts for the 2024/25 season, equates to £1.533million, but the complainant alleges Newcastle’s decision to instead sell the kit exclusively through JD Sports and their official stores is in breach of the Competitions Act. Newcastle have until March 28 to reply to the claim, before a hearing on April 9. The claim also asks for damages to be paid. The Magpies will change kit suppliers from Castore to Adidas next season and Sports Direct expected their current agreement to continue. However, the claim alleges that under a new agreement, only Adidas, JD Sports and Newcastle themselves will be able to sell the 2024/25 strip. The news continues Ashley’s tumultuous relationship with Newcaslte, the team he purchased in 2007 before selling it to Saudi Arabia’s Public Investment Fund in 2021. Ashley was a hugely unpopular owner for the majority of his tenure, with fans protesting his reign, largely citing a lack of investment. Yet despite relinquishing control of the club in October 2021 - to much celebration - Ashley’s relationship with the current regime remains tense. They have previously clashed over a loan to facilitate the takeover, and also the removal of Sports Direct signage at St. James’ Park.

(AP Photo/Michael Conroy)           NEW YORK (AP) — Sue Bird can relate to Caitlin Clark’s early frustrations about losing in the WNBA. But Bird knows from experience how things could change for the much-talked about rookie. Now 43, Bird played at UConn, where she won two NCAA titles and lost only four games. Clark led her Iowa team to consecutive NCAA championship games while becoming the Division I career scoring leader. Both were No. 1 picks in the WNBA draft — 22 years apart — and landed on last-place teams. Clark’s Indiana Fever have just one win in their first seven games. Bird, who eventually won four WNBA titles with Seattle, recommends patience for Clark. She recently watched courtside when New York beat Clark and Indiana before more than 17,000 fans at the Barclays Center. Now a part-owner of the Storm, Bird joins Lisa Leslie (LA Sparks) and Renee Montgomery (Atlanta Dream) as former WNBA players-turned-owners. Bird thinks more lucrative broadcast rights contracts and an improved collective bargaining agreement will “dramatically” change the WNBA landscape in the next few years. That may include better salaries, more teams and more players on a roster. Clark will earn just $76,000 as the No. 1 pick, although she signed NIL deals in college with Gatorade, State Farm and recently with Wilson as a pro. However, many in the WNBA still compete in other countries to supplement their income, given the 2024 veteran super maximum is $241,000. 
 The NBA has broadcast rights that generate more than $20 billion in revenue, and the 2023 top draft pick, Victor Wembanyama, earned $12.1 million in his rookie season with San Antonio. The NBA minimum salary is $1.1 million, with Golden State’s Steph Curry the top earner at $51.9 million this year. Bird spoke with The Associated Press during the recent Business of Women’s Sports Summit in New York City on several topics. Her comments have been edited for clarity and brevity: Bird: If I’m being honest, we’ve done our part (as players). The product on the floor has never been better. Now it’s the media rights deal, its on corporate sponsors to continue to show up and view us as an investment. But once we see this media rights deal, assuming its going to be what we all think its going to be, you’re going to see things dramatically change in the WNBA. It will be a whole new world. We have a hard salary cap somewhere in the $1.4 million range. But once the money gets interjected and maybe there’s a soft cap — now we’re talking. The media rights contract is up this year. The CBA has an opt out next year — so by 2026, it could be dramatically different. Bird: I think long term, you want the WNBA to be thriving in a way where people feel like they don’t have to go overseas. But I do still see overseas as a viable option for players who want to continue to play in their offseason and get paid a lot of money. Even if there was a G League, the money would still be better overseas. Bird: I love NIL. I know its complicated in terms of figuring it out — the ways in which schools participate in it, collectives and deals. To me, it’s just growing pains. I’m sure there will be some rule changes as they go, but it will all settle. Kids coming into college have access to the greatest marketing machine in the world — the NCAA Tournament and ... being on ESPN. There’s a popularity and you’re connecting with a brand. There’s no better example than Caitlin Clark, who signed a deal with Nike in college and look who followed her to the pros. It impacts the whole ecosystem in a wonderful way. Bird: Just being able to do what I want. It’s nice to not have to worry that I have to eat by 4 p.m. because my game is at 7 p.m. They see us hanging out on the couch watching the game and that’s exactly what we’d be doing if we were at home with no cameras. We’re trying to get a bigger piece of the pie in terms of coverage, having women cover the sport and former athletes cover the sport. Bird: We want to shine a light on those that normally don’t get it — women, women of color. They’re so important and crucial to the backbone of all you see in women’s sports. We’ve adapted a book “Cleat Cute,” it’s an incredibly popular book in the LGBTQ space, into a TV show. AP WNBA: https://apnews.com/hub/wnba-basketball Copyright 2024 The Associated Press.

3,Sue Bird,What Is Sue Bird’s Net Worth? Everything You Need to Know About New Deal With Seattle Storm?,https://www.essentiallysports.com/wnba-basketball-news-what-is-sue-birds-net-worth-everything-you-need-to-know-about-new-deal-with-seattle-storm/,"More Sports ES Fancast Apr 25, 2024 | 9:30 AM CDT One of the most decorated female athletes coming out of Seattle, Sue Bird, is now the proud owner of a basketball franchise. In a monumental decision, the Seattle Storm management announced that the 4-time WNBA champion is now a part of their ownership group. This takes the Bird brand to new heights, as the move can positively impact her net worth.  However, there are still no financial details about this current deal made visible to the public. Still, there are some specifics that we can get our hands on. ADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad With an estimated net worth ranging between $8 million to $10 million, Sue Bird indulges in perhaps the most emotional investment of all. The creators of Force 10 Hoops had a landmark announcement to make on Wednesday. After an illustrious career that spanned almost two decades, the 43-year-old will now join Lisa Brummel, Ginny Gilder, and Dawn Trudeau in this “smart business.“ This development comes just after the Storm unveiled their new Seattle Storm Center for Basketball Performance. Seemingly, it is a $64 million state-of-the-art practice facility recently opened by the franchise.     A post shared by Seattle Storm (@seattlestorm)  Elated by this association, Bird expressed her thoughts in an official press release. She said, “As a player, I poured my heart into every game for the Seattle Storm, and now, as part of the ownership group, I am thrilled to continue contributing to the growth of the game. Investing in women’s sports isn’t just about passion; it’s smart business. It’s about recognizing the immense talent, dedication, and market potential our league has always had.”  Anyhow, this is not the only investment that this iconic WNBA figure can flaunt. Soon after her retirement, Sue Bird indulged herself in various businesses from time to time. New Jersey-based NWSL club Gotham FC included the 13-time WNBA All-Star in its ownership group in July 2022. Similarly, she has also utilized her money in fitness brands like Tonal and AI company Diveplane. In addition to this, a women’s sports media brand called TOGETHXR is a joint venture of Sue Bird with USWNT legend Alex Morgan, Olympic Gold Medalist snowboarder Chloe Kim, and Olympic Gold Medalist swimmer Simone Manuel. The company was founded in 2021.      A post shared by Sue Bird (@sbird10)  Meanwhile, there were also some attractive endorsements that Bird made the most of as an athlete. Very early in her career, she had lucrative deals with brands like Nike, State Farm, Symetra, American Express, CarMax, and Corona. These hold a combined worth of around $1.5 million. Not to forget, she also appeared in various commercials for Mendi, Glossier, and American Express. While she currently resides in Seattle, her real estate IQ has resulted in the accumulation of properties in New York, Connecticut, and Los Angeles. Also, she owns a fascinating collection of cars from a range of companies like Mercedes, Lexus, and Tesla. ADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad These are after she hung up her boots in 2022 after earning a substantial professional income. One of the financial highlights of the former Seattle Storm point guard was that she remained one of the highest-paid athletes for most of her career. Selected to be part of the roster in 2002. In an interview with ’60 Minutes’, she made the revelation that her initial contracts promised $60,000 per annum. This number surged in 2014, and Bird’s five-year deal promised her a sum of $673,000. This was further elevated to $215,000 per year when the WNBA’s new CBA was introduced in 2020. Eventually, Bird ended her career after earning $2.4 million from the league.  ADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad Still, a major portion of her income came from participating in overseas leagues. For 10 years, she became a part of numerous franchises in the Russian Premier League. Her talent and skills helped her collect paychecks ranging from $400,000 to $1 million per season.  The news of Sue Bird being a joint owner at Seattle Storm comes as a delight for many. Moreover, her understanding of the game and her 20-year experience will prove crucial for them in the WNBA. There are only a handful of individuals with her expertise who can contribute to the franchises’ betterment. It will be enthralling to witness what changes she can bring to the Storm’s fortunes in the upcoming season.  EssentiallySports is a digital-first sports media house that surfaces the best stories on America's favorite sports celebrities with a fan's perspective to 30+ M average monthly readers.

4,Lexie Brown,"The flyest AAU team: Antonio Davis as coach, Ken Griffey Jr.'s daughter, two WNBA Finals players and a whole lot of winning",https://theathletic.com/2885337/2021/10/15/the-flyest-aau-team-antonio-davis-as-coach-ken-griffey-jr-s-daughter-two-wnba-finals-players-and-a-whole-lot-of-winning/,"Editor’s Note: This story is included in The Athletic’s Best of 2021. View the full list. Clap-clap…clap. Yup! Clap-clap…clap. Yup! Ahh. The familiar sound in AAU gyms all over the country as Soulja Boy’s “Donk” rang out while the clock wound down in warmups. It was 2007. I was 12 years old and preparing to play my first AAU game as a member of the Georgia Ice. Clap-clap…clap. NOPE! Clap-clap … clap. NOPE! My AAU team had remixed the smash hit to let our opponents know, as regulation ended and we were locking up yet another victory, that we were not some random team to be taken lightly. Advertisement I walked out to the parking lot with my parents after the game to see our opponents angrily shoving their keys into ignitions and driving off. “Whoa,” I thought. “They’re old enough to drive?” We had beaten a U17 team in our first action together, and that’s when I knew: This team was very different. It was the start of my youth basketball career with several future WNBA players who just happened to be the daughters of superstar professional athletes. Baseball greats Ken Griffey Jr. and Delino DeShields, and NBA stars like Dee Brown, Antonio Davis and Kevin Whitted along with a slew of other former Division I athletes, had children on my AAU teams destined to follow in their athletic footsteps. My dad? He was a paralegal. We were regular tweens who had silly sleepovers. The difference? Those were sometimes hosted at the Griffey’s massive mansion. We flew first class to an AAU championship. We came from different backgrounds, but we fit well together. And we made up the flyest AAU girls basketball team around. Years later, it’s Lexie Brown and Diamond DeShields who have most closely followed in their dads’ athletic footsteps. They’re teammates again with the Chicago Sky, playing in the WNBA Finals against the Phoenix Mercury. “Time just kind of separates you,” Diamond said when we caught up recently. “We went to college and then life happens. And so being here now, I think it reminds us both how much we need each other.” how it started:              how it’s going: pic.twitter.com/eB4fqSHIP1 — Lexie Brown (@Lexiebrown) June 3, 2021  “I don’t know why all of a sudden the universe brought us back together, but without us building our relationship back then, I probably wouldn’t be on this team right now,” Lexie said. In the winter of 2007, I was warming up to play for St. Pius X Catholic High School in Metro Atlanta when a tall, lanky 6-foot-something girl walked into the gym with her much-taller, much-lankier father. I didn’t pay it too much mind. Just barely 5-foot, everyone was taller than me. What I didn’t expect, though, was having to guard her. Advertisement I did my best and held my own, which was apparently enough for a post-game handshake from the lanky point guard and her proud papa. I’d learn that the girl was Kaela Davis and that her father was former NBA player Antonio Davis. They had moved from Chicago to Atlanta and were looking to start an AAU team. My family and I drove back home freaking out. I had always been a scrappy little something, but I never imagined catching the eye of an NBA player. Even though my team had been defeated, no one in the gym could deny that the smallest person on the court was at least the second best player that day. “I actually didn’t want to coach at all, just because I’m not good at cutting kids,” Davis told me when we caught up this week. “But it was right around the time I was retiring so everything kind of fell into place.” At the tryout, I noticed everybody was so tall. And I wasn’t. Which was normal. But these girls were all really tall. “Coach Antonio” put us through one of the most intense workouts I’d ever been through. My dad was there with me. He had coached my former AAU team before that team split up. I made it through the workout, holding my own against undoubtedly the best girls my age in the state of Georgia. Davis called my parents a couple days later asking if I would like to be a member of the Georgia Ice, his new girls’ basketball team. I remember jumping on Google, maybe on my iPod touch, and typing “Antonio Davis.” Whoa. He played for the Bulls and Pacers. He played against — no way! — Michael Jordan. “Welcome to the Space Jam” must have been playing in my mind. That movie was the reason I started playing basketball. Now I’m a degree of separation from Jordan? Davis invited the team to his house to get to know each other. I use the term “house” loosely. A movie theater, a game room, a pool, a basketball court. The elevator was the thing that blew my mind. I had never seen anything like it. Advertisement Before I knew it, I was over there pretty often. It was the coolest thing ever to me. And our team was talented in equal measure. One of our first tournaments was at Georgia Tech. We all arrived at the gym early to change into our bright orange and light blue uniforms. Georgia Ice. We were the first AAU team that I remember to wear Nike Elite socks. We had our names on the back of our jerseys, our numbers on the sides of our shoes. We qualified for the national championships pretty early in the AAU season. My family and I had never flown before. Davis bought the entire team first-class tickets. We were a bunch of 12-year-old girls in first class having the time of our lives on an NBA superstar’s dime. We won the 12U National Championship in 2008. “I was really just looking for girls with raw talent, to teach them to play the right way,” Davis said. “I always wanted to practice more than I wanted to play but we just ended up getting really good.” Things got really interesting the next year. Every girl playing basketball in the area at the time wanted to play for the Georgia Ice. I was about 1,000 times more nervous at this tryout. And boy, were there some superstars in the gym: Kaela Davis (Anthony’s daughter), Lexie Brown (Dee’s daughter), Taryn Griffey (Ken’s daughter), Diamond DeShields (Delino’s daughter). The fact that so many famous fathers had come together to form this girl-dad super team was unheard of at the time. This was pre-“girl dad” era. But they learned from an early age about teamwork and work ethic. “I think the vibe that we put out really just attracted more dads and daughters who really wanted to learn how to play the game the right way,” Davis said. “The craziest thing for me was that Ken Griffey Jrs., Dee Browns and others of the world trusted me with their daughters and this process.” Lexie and Kaela grew up together when Davis and Dee Brown played together for the Toronto Raptors. Lexie and Taryn Griffey later played on the same AAU team in Orlando while we were forming the Georgia Ice in Atlanta. Their moms became friends and the girls played on the same team, meaning Lexie and Taryn attended school in Orlando during the week and then drove or flew to Atlanta on the weekends to compete with the Georgia Ice. Advertisement Diamond, on the other hand, was like me. Her AAU team had disbanded and she was looking for an AAU home. We had played against each other several times growing up. Our teams had a bit of an U11 rivalry, if there was such a thing at that age. “At that point, I knew who I wanted to play with. I said, I’m going to play with them,” Diamond said. Brown called the Georgia Ice a “super team.” “None of that was actually planned,” Davis said. “When we had the opportunity to add someone like Diamond DeShields, I didn’t know if she was going to be a good fit. I knew she was extremely athletic and had all the tools, I just didn’t know if she was going to mesh with our team. But each and every girl that came our way just ended up being the perfect piece.” We’d grow together as a team and as young women over the course of that season under the guidance of the GOAT dads. Having Davis lead us reminded me a lot of when my dad coached me, but I often wondered how it was to have a superstar dad. And to have to perform in front of him. It formed a bond among players. “For me, just the fact that Kaela, Lexie, Peyton (Whitted) and Taryn all had parents who were pros,” Diamond said, “I got to interact with kids that kind of grew up the same way as I did in that aspect. It was cool.” Lexie said: “I think that’s why me and Diamond have been able to bond and stay close over the years because we have very similar upbringings, and we can appreciate that about each other.” Those sleepovers, though, were something. In our second year together, the AAU national championships were conveniently held in Orlando, where Taryn and Lexie lived. While our parents went back to their hotel rooms after games, the whole team spent the weekend at the Griffeys’ house. I remember one couch so big all 15 of us slept on it comfortably. Advertisement Sometimes we’d be in hotel lobbies after games and the dad’s traded stories from Griffey’s greatest hits to Davis’ time playing against Jordan. My family would sit in awe. In time, we all grew pretty close. “It just became like a family,” Lexie said. We’d spend our time watching the YouTube videos that were going “viral” at the time. We liked to create our own content back then — before it was trendy. ‘We were doing viral shit before viral was a thing,” said DeShields. In the summer of 2009, we traveled to Virginia for the Boo Williams Invitational. As the starting point guard, I suffered an ACL injury that Lexie says changed the course of her career, giving her more time at the position. (I don’t know if I can agree with that given her talent!) “It was Diamond’s coming out party for us for sure,” said Lexie. Every D1 women’s basketball coach you could think of lined the sidelines to watch us work. The “greatest show on ice,” as we were called, was as popular as it had ever been, coming off of two AAU national championships and garnering elite-level college looks. Olympic gold medalist Allisha Gray eventually joined the team as well. The good times would eventually end as they always have to. We’d all go on to focus on playing for our high school teams. I went to Collins Hill High School and had the pleasure of getting my brains beat in over the next four years by Diamond at Norcross High and Lexie at North Gwinnett. We began to compete against each other more than we played together. Priorities became different for some. I, for example, was now quite certain that I was not going to play professionally, and was just hoping to secure a scholarship. I eventually signed to play Division II basketball at the University of Montevallo in Alabama. Lexie committed to Maryland, Diamond to North Carolina, Kaela and Allisha to South Carolina,  Peyton Whitted to Penn State, Kristina Nelson to Notre Dame and Kylee Smith to Belmont. Advertisement From there, life did its thing. Lexie transferred to Duke to finish. Diamond to Tennessee. Kaela and Allisha won a national championship with Dawn Staley. I transferred to the University of West Georgia. Allison was drafted fourth in 2017 by the Dallas Wings. Kaela went to Dallas as well, a few picks later at No. 10. Diamond was drafted No. 3 overall by the Chicago Sky in 2018. Lexie would be a few picks behind at No. 9 to the Connecticut Sun. After playing in Hungary for a season, Lexie was traded to the Minnesota Lynx where she played a significant role coming off of the bench for two seasons before injuries slowed her momentum heading into the bubble. Lexie was waived by Chicago after training camp earlier this season before she was brought back and signed permanently. She said her rekindled friendship with Diamond helped her feel comfortable joining the Sky. “Yeah, getting to Chicago, for me, was like a hot ass mess,” she said. “You know, me and Diamond’s relationship actually wasn’t the greatest in college. “I was out of the league this year for three weeks, so it’s really hard to get in. It’s even harder to stay in. Having the relationships with the right people and you have to carry yourself professionally; you can find a way back, and Diamond was a huge part of that.” if you told us we would be finishing a WNBA season together….we wouldn’t have even believed it 😭❤️ pic.twitter.com/hchwpsm6Yr — Lexie Brown (@Lexiebrown) September 19, 2021  They played for different teams in the “Wubble” last season and didn’t talk. When Diamond suffered an injury, Lexie’s mom encouraged her to reach out. “My mom was just like, I think she needs you back in her life,” Brown said. “I was like, ‘Nah, she’s fine.’ But, I invited her over for Thanksgiving. I was still with Minnesota at the time, but I was already feeling weird about that situation. She was like, yeah you should just come play with us in Chicago. James loves your game and I would love for you to be there.” Advertisement Lexie felt comfortable in Minnesota at the time but had Diamond put in a good word with Chicago. Lexie and the Lynx eventually parted ways at the end of 2020. “Chicago was the first team that called my agent,” she said. “They were trying to trade for me during free agency and they just couldn’t. I think that everything was a blessing in disguise.” Even as kids winning titles together, Lexie and Diamond didn’t dream about playing for a professional championship. “Being this close now, to possibly getting to the WNBA Finals together … which is a conversation neither one of us have ever had together,” Lexie said. Chicago, the No. 6 seed, is in the finals for the first time since 2014. The Sky play Game 3 Friday in Chicago with the series against Phoenix tied 1-1. The possibility of winning a championship together — as adults now — becomes more real every day for both Lexie and Diamond. “Even when Diamond was a little younger, she had doubts,” Lexie says. “She had self-doubt about her even getting to the WNBA. That was a shocking revelation to me. I remember when we all walked into the gym at 13 years old and thinking, ‘Wow. These guys are going to the league and I am not.’” We had played against each other for so long but I don’t ever remember Diamond being a no-name. So when she came in, I already knew she was like that. Seeing them achieve all these years later makes our childhood memories all the sweeter. Looking back, we were good teen players. Now we see it as the start of successful basketball careers for some. “I know when I walked in I was like, oh, this is a different level of tough,” Diamond said. “Like, oh man, I’m going to take what I can here,” DeShields said. “I thought everybody was just equally tough. I just saw everybody as an equal. At that point, I felt like we were all the best 13-year-olds on the planet.” Looking back, I think we were.

View the full list. Clap-clap…clap. Yup! Clap-clap…clap. Yup! Ahh. The familiar sound in AAU gyms all over the country as Soulja Boy’s “Donk” rang out while the clock wound down in warmups. It was 2007. I was 12 years old and preparing to play my first AAU game as a member of the Georgia Ice. Clap-clap…clap. NOPE! Clap-clap … clap. NOPE! My AAU team had remixed the smash hit to let our opponents know, as regulation ended and we were locking up yet another victory, that we were not some random team to be taken lightly. Advertisement I walked out to the parking lot with my parents after the game to see our opponents angrily shoving their keys into ignitions and driving off. “Whoa,” I thought. “They’re old enough to drive?” We had beaten a U17 team in our first action together, and that’s when I knew: This team was very different. It was the start of my youth basketball career with several future WNBA players who just happened to be the daughters of superstar professional athletes. Baseball greats Ken Griffey Jr. and Delino DeShields, and NBA stars like Dee Brown, Antonio Davis and Kevin Whitted along with a slew of other former Division I athletes, had children on my AAU teams destined to follow in their athletic footsteps. My dad? He was a paralegal. We were regular tweens who had silly sleepovers. The difference? Those were sometimes hosted at the Griffey’s massive mansion. We flew first class to an AAU championship. We came from different backgrounds, but we fit well together. And we made up the flyest AAU girls basketball team around. Years later, it’s Lexie Brown and Diamond DeShields who have most closely followed in their dads’ athletic footsteps. They’re teammates again with the Chicago Sky, playing in the WNBA Finals against the Phoenix Mercury. “Time just kind of separates you,” Diamond said when we caught up recently. “We went to college and then life happens. And so being here now, I think it reminds us both how much we need each other.” how it started:              how it’s going: pic.twitter.com/eB4fqSHIP1 — Lexie Brown (@Lexiebrown) June 3, 2021  “I don’t know why all of a sudden the universe brought us back together, but without us building our relationship back then, I probably wouldn’t be on this team right now,” Lexie said. In the winter of 2007, I was warming up to play for St. Pius X Catholic High School in Metro Atlanta when a tall, lanky 6-foot-something girl walked into the gym with her much-taller, much-lankier father. I didn’t pay it too much mind. Just barely 5-foot, everyone was taller than me. What I didn’t expect, though, was having to guard her. Advertisement I did my best and held my own, which was apparently enough for a post-game handshake from the lanky point guard and her proud papa. I’d learn that the girl was Kaela Davis and that her father was former NBA player Antonio Davis. They had moved from Chicago to Atlanta and were looking to start an AAU team. My family and I drove back home freaking out. I had always been a scrappy little something, but I never imagined catching the eye of an NBA player. Even though my team had been defeated, no one in the gym could deny that the smallest person on the court was at least the second best player that day. “I actually didn’t want to coach at all, just because I’m not good at cutting kids,” Davis told me when we caught up this week. “But it was right around the time I was retiring so everything kind of fell into place.” At the tryout, I noticed everybody was so tall. And I wasn’t. Which was normal. But these girls were all really tall. “Coach Antonio” put us through one of the most intense workouts I’d ever been through. My dad was there with me. He had coached my former AAU team before that team split up. I made it through the workout, holding my own against undoubtedly the best girls my age in the state of Georgia. Davis called my parents a couple days later asking if I would like to be a member of the Georgia Ice, his new girls’ basketball team. I remember jumping on Google, maybe on my iPod touch, and typing “Antonio Davis.” Whoa. He played for the Bulls and Pacers. He played against — no way! — Michael Jordan. “Welcome to the Space Jam” must have been playing in my mind. That movie was the reason I started playing basketball. Now I’m a degree of separation from Jordan? Davis invited the team to his house to get to know each other. I use the term “house” loosely. A movie theater, a game room, a pool, a basketball court. The elevator was the thing that blew my mind. I had never seen anything like it. Advertisement Before I knew it, I was over there pretty often. It was the coolest thing ever to me. And our team was talented in equal measure. One of our first tournaments was at Georgia Tech. We all arrived at the gym early to change into our bright orange and light blue uniforms. Georgia Ice. We were the first AAU team that I remember to wear Nike Elite socks. We had our names on the back of our jerseys, our numbers on the sides of our shoes. We qualified for the national championships pretty early in the AAU season. My family and I had never flown before. Davis bought the entire team first-class tickets. We were a bunch of 12-year-old girls in first class having the time of our lives on an NBA superstar’s dime. We won the 12U National Championship in 2008. “I was really just looking for girls with raw talent, to teach them to play the right way,” Davis said. “I always wanted to practice more than I wanted to play but we just ended up getting really good.” Things got really interesting the next year. Every girl playing basketball in the area at the time wanted to play for the Georgia Ice. I was about 1,000 times more nervous at this tryout. And boy, were there some superstars in the gym: Kaela Davis (Anthony’s daughter), Lexie Brown (Dee’s daughter), Taryn Griffey (Ken’s daughter), Diamond DeShields (Delino’s daughter). The fact that so many famous fathers had come together to form this girl-dad super team was unheard of at the time. This was pre-“girl dad” era. But they learned from an early age about teamwork and work ethic. “I think the vibe that we put out really just attracted more dads and daughters who really wanted to learn how to play the game the right way,” Davis said. “The craziest thing for me was that Ken Griffey Jrs., Dee Browns and others of the world trusted me with their daughters and this process.” Lexie and Kaela grew up together when Davis and Dee Brown played together for the Toronto Raptors. Lexie and Taryn Griffey later played on the same AAU team in Orlando while we were forming the Georgia Ice in Atlanta. Their moms became friends and the girls played on the same team, meaning Lexie and Taryn attended school in Orlando during the week and then drove or flew to Atlanta on the weekends to compete with the Georgia Ice. Advertisement Diamond, on the other hand, was like me. Her AAU team had disbanded and she was looking for an AAU home. We had played against each other several times growing up. Our teams had a bit of an U11 rivalry, if there was such a thing at that age. “At that point, I knew who I wanted to play with. I said, I’m going to play with them,” Diamond said. Brown called the Georgia Ice a “super team.” “None of that was actually planned,” Davis said. “When we had the opportunity to add someone like Diamond DeShields, I didn’t know if she was going to be a good fit. I knew she was extremely athletic and had all the tools, I just didn’t know if she was going to mesh with our team. But each and every girl that came our way just ended up being the perfect piece.” We’d grow together as a team and as young women over the course of that season under the guidance of the GOAT dads. Having Davis lead us reminded me a lot of when my dad coached me, but I often wondered how it was to have a superstar dad. And to have to perform in front of him. It formed a bond among players. “For me, just the fact that Kaela, Lexie, Peyton (Whitted) and Taryn all had parents who were pros,” Diamond said, “I got to interact with kids that kind of grew up the same way as I did in that aspect. It was cool.” Lexie said: “I think that’s why me and Diamond have been able to bond and stay close over the years because we have very similar upbringings, and we can appreciate that about each other.” Those sleepovers, though, were something. In our second year together, the AAU national championships were conveniently held in Orlando, where Taryn and Lexie lived. While our parents went back to their hotel rooms after games, the whole team spent the weekend at the Griffeys’ house. I remember one couch so big all 15 of us slept on it comfortably. Advertisement Sometimes we’d be in hotel lobbies after games and the dad’s traded stories from Griffey’s greatest hits to Davis’ time playing against Jordan. My family would sit in awe. In time, we all grew pretty close. “It just became like a family,” Lexie said. We’d spend our time watching the YouTube videos that were going “viral” at the time. We liked to create our own content back then — before it was trendy. ‘We were doing viral shit before viral was a thing,” said DeShields. In the summer of 2009, we traveled to Virginia for the Boo Williams Invitational. As the starting point guard, I suffered an ACL injury that Lexie says changed the course of her career, giving her more time at the position. (I don’t know if I can agree with that given her talent!) “It was Diamond’s coming out party for us for sure,” said Lexie. Every D1 women’s basketball coach you could think of lined the sidelines to watch us work. The “greatest show on ice,” as we were called, was as popular as it had ever been, coming off of two AAU national championships and garnering elite-level college looks. Olympic gold medalist Allisha Gray eventually joined the team as well. The good times would eventually end as they always have to. We’d all go on to focus on playing for our high school teams. I went to Collins Hill High School and had the pleasure of getting my brains beat in over the next four years by Diamond at Norcross High and Lexie at North Gwinnett. We began to compete against each other more than we played together. Priorities became different for some. I, for example, was now quite certain that I was not going to play professionally, and was just hoping to secure a scholarship. I eventually signed to play Division II basketball at the University of Montevallo in Alabama. Lexie committed to Maryland, Diamond to North Carolina, Kaela and Allisha to South Carolina,  Peyton Whitted to Penn State, Kristina Nelson to Notre Dame and Kylee Smith to Belmont. Advertisement From there, life did its thing. Lexie transferred to Duke to finish. Diamond to Tennessee. Kaela and Allisha won a national championship with Dawn Staley. I transferred to the University of West Georgia. Allison was drafted fourth in 2017 by the Dallas Wings. Kaela went to Dallas as well, a few picks later at No. 10. Diamond was drafted No. 3 overall by the Chicago Sky in 2018. Lexie would be a few picks behind at No. 9 to the Connecticut Sun. After playing in Hungary for a season, Lexie was traded to the Minnesota Lynx where she played a significant role coming off of the bench for two seasons before injuries slowed her momentum heading into the bubble. Lexie was waived by Chicago after training camp earlier this season before she was brought back and signed permanently. She said her rekindled friendship with Diamond helped her feel comfortable joining the Sky. “Yeah, getting to Chicago, for me, was like a hot ass mess,” she said. “You know, me and Diamond’s relationship actually wasn’t the greatest in college. “I was out of the league this year for three weeks, so it’s really hard to get in. It’s even harder to stay in. Having the relationships with the right people and you have to carry yourself professionally; you can find a way back, and Diamond was a huge part of that.” if you told us we would be finishing a WNBA season together….we wouldn’t have even believed it 😭❤️ pic.twitter.com/hchwpsm6Yr — Lexie Brown (@Lexiebrown) September 19, 2021  They played for different teams in the “Wubble” last season and didn’t talk. When Diamond suffered an injury, Lexie’s mom encouraged her to reach out. “My mom was just like, I think she needs you back in her life,” Brown said. “I was like, ‘Nah, she’s fine.’ But, I invited her over for Thanksgiving. I was still with Minnesota at the time, but I was already feeling weird about that situation. She was like, yeah you should just come play with us in Chicago. James loves your game and I would love for you to be there.” Advertisement Lexie felt comfortable in Minnesota at the time but had Diamond put in a good word with Chicago. Lexie and the Lynx eventually parted ways at the end of 2020. “Chicago was the first team that called my agent,” she said. “They were trying to trade for me during free agency and they just couldn’t. I think that everything was a blessing in disguise.” Even as kids winning titles together, Lexie and Diamond didn’t dream about playing for a professional championship. “Being this close now, to possibly getting to the WNBA Finals together … which is a conversation neither one of us have ever had together,” Lexie said. Chicago, the No. 6 seed, is in the finals for the first time since 2014. The Sky play Game 3 Friday in Chicago with the series against Phoenix tied 1-1. The possibility of winning a championship together — as adults now — becomes more real every day for both Lexie and Diamond. “Even when Diamond was a little younger, she had doubts,” Lexie says. “She had self-doubt about her even getting to the WNBA. That was a shocking revelation to me. I remember when we all walked into the gym at 13 years old and thinking, ‘Wow. These guys are going to the league and I am not.’” We had played against each other for so long but I don’t ever remember Diamond being a no-name. So when she came in, I already knew she was like that. Seeing them achieve all these years later makes our childhood memories all the sweeter. Looking back, we were good teen players. Now we see it as the start of successful basketball careers for some. “I know when I walked in I was like, oh, this is a different level of tough,” Diamond said. “Like, oh man, I’m going to take what I can here,” DeShields said. “I thought everybody was just equally tough. I just saw everybody as an equal. At that point, I felt like we were all the best 13-year-olds on the planet.” Looking back, I think we were.

6,Tamika Catchings,50 years of Title IX: Meet the next generation of star female athletes from D-FW,https://www.dallasnews.com/high-school-sports/2022/06/16/50-years-of-title-ix-meet-the-next-generation-of-star-female-athletes-from-d-fw/,"High School Sports By  Greg RiddleSportsDayHS writer and editor By  Greg RiddleSportsDayHS writer and editor 8:00 AM on Jun 16, 2022 CDT There have been some incredible female athletes to come out of the Dallas area. Tamika Catchings, Michelle Carter, Sha’Carri Richardson, Nastia Liukin and Carly Patterson are just a few. As the United States celebrates the 50th anniversary of Title IX, here is a look at the next generation of local phenoms who are already competing on the national or world stage, or are about to reach that level. Texas talent: Meet some more of the most influential and pioneering female athletes in history The latest news, analysis, predictions and more for each season. Or with:  By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy The 17-year-old who trains at the famed WOGA qualified to the 2021 U.S. Olympic trials — a quadrennium before she expected to be eligible — and is a strong all-around contender for world championship and Olympic teams to come. The Shelton product spent time in 2019 training alongside World Cup players with England’s Manchester City and Spain’s Atletico Madrid. Byars was offered a pro contract by Atletico Madrid while in high school but decided to attend Texas and led UT with 12 goals as a freshman last season. Byars is one of three Texans, along with Jaedyn Shaw and UT teammate Alexis “Lexi” Missimo, who will be heading to France later this month to play for the U.S. Under-20 Women’s Youth National Team in the Sud Ladies Cup. The former The Colony standout is a candidate for future U.S. national teams and to play professionally. Coleman was one of the stars of the Oklahoma team that just won its second straight NCAA championship. The 2020 Gatorade National Softball Player of the Year was a first-team All-American as a freshman at OU, and as a sophomore she entered the Women’s College World Series with the second-best batting average (.429, trailing only Jocelyn Alo) on arguably the greatest team in NCAA history. The 19-year-old Flower Mound graduate was named the National Girls Cross Country Player of the Year as a senior and is already running world-class times in track. The Oklahoma State signee broke the high school national record in the 5,000 meters this year with a time of 15:25.93. That’s faster than the winning time at the 2021 NCAA Championships and last summer’s U.S. Olympic Trials, and as of Tuesday it ranked 32nd among all American women (including pros and collegians) for 2022. Cook broke the state record by running 4:36.96 in the 1,600, and her two-mile time of 9:44.44 indoors is the second-fastest time in U.S. high school history. The 16-year-old from McKinney is a five-star recruit in the Class of 2024 and is No. 6 in the ITF world junior rankings. She trains at Keller’s Dent Tennis Academy, which is run by former Australian Open runner-up Phi Dent and his son, former pro tennis player Taylor Dent. She reached the semifinals in the junior girls singles at the Australian Open and was a quarterfinalist in junior girls singles and doubles at the French Open. She won the prestigious ITF Adidas Easter Bowl as a 15-year-old in 2021, beating USC signee Madison Sieg, who was the No. 1 seed. Since moving to WOGA in 2021, the 17-year-old gymnast has already made a world championships team, won a national all-around competition and grown into her potential as the sport’s next leading star in Simone Biles’ absence. The Southlake Carroll product is ranked as the fourth-best player in the world under the age of 20 by GOAL.com. She was the No. 1 recruit in the nation coming out of high school and was told by England’s Manchester City and Arsenal WFC that they had pro opportunities waiting for her if she decided to skip college. Missimo chose to attend Texas and was a first-team all-Big 12 Conference selection as a freshman after scoring nine goals and tying a school record with 14 assists. She might leave UT early and turn pro, possibly after one more season of college. The former Mansfield Lake Ridge superstar competed in the triple jump at the Olympics last summer and then had an amazing sophomore season at Florida, winning four national titles (indoors and outdoors in both the triple jump and long jump). Moore ranks sixth in the world for 2022 in the triple jump (47-9.75) and is seventh in the long jump (22-4.5), according to Track & Field News. Only two women in U.S. history have jumped farther than Moore’s 47-9.75, and Moore set an NCAA indoor record with that mark. The Frisco native made her first big splash at the age of 12 when she made an appearance for the FC Dallas women’s team in the Women’s Premier Soccer League. Shaw was 14 when she committed to 21-time national champion North Carolina and when she went to France to train with a professional team, Paris Saint-Germain (PSG). Now 17 and home schooled, Shaw is training with another pro team, the Washington Spirit of the National Women’s Soccer League. She thinks she could be offered a pro contract soon. The Class of 2025 phenom from McKinney qualified for five USGA events before she was 14, and she was 14 when she played in her first LPGA event. She won her first American Junior Golf Association tournament in 2021 — the ANNIKA Invitational — with 10-time major champion Annika Sorenstam watching. Also in 2021, Zweig was the first alternate for the U.S. Women’s Open. +++ - Texas talent: Meet some of the most influential and pioneering female athletes in history - As Title IX turns 50, University of Texas exes reflected on common bond of championships - Jody Conradt, University of Texas embody the shaping, struggles and success of Title IX - How pro path for female athletes has changed since Title IX, and where it needs to improve - 50 years of Title IX: Meet the next generation of star female athletes from D-FW +++ Find more sports coverage from The Dallas Morning News here.

As kids growing up, we were running around Italy, running around the streets of Rome. Who would have thought we would both have the careers we have had? I am extremely proud of you, one of the all-time greatest players. Make sure you enjoy retirement. Kick back and relax.” Tamika Catchings retired as an all-time great in the WNBA. The 12-time All WNBA and WNBA defensive team player also was a 1-MVP, 1-time FMVP, and 1-time Champion as she won the title with the Indiana Fever 2012. Catchings, in a recent appearance on ‘Christy’s Court,’ spoke about her regret on the fact that she and Kobe had gradually drifted off over the years. She said – “We always think that we have another day. I have realized is there were a lot of times when our paths had crossed like, we were in the same space. But it’s like oh I’ll talked to him next time. Yeah, you never even think that you’re not going to get that next time, you’re not going to get that next interaction.” When asked about the last time Tamika had the opportunity to meet Bryant, she responded by saying – “Kobe and I’ve been a while, you know, and the W NBA All-Star game was in Vegas in 2019. I went down there. Kobe was down there, I was rooting Bolton and Holly field and she was like, oh, there’s Kobe. Let’s go down. Nah. Like Nah, like, I’ll catch him.

Lakers legend Bryant actually started his career with the number 8 and then switched to 24 later. He also donned the number 10 when he played for the USA National team at the Olympics. He made these numbers iconic. But according to fellow Hall of Famer Tamika Catchings, Kobe actually copied her when it came to jersey numbers. Catchings and Bryant grew up together when their fathers played for the same NBA team. Later they also spent some years of their childhood together in Italy. So they were close. But since she was the older one, she felt Bryant was copying her. ADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad She revealed this in a recent interview when she said, “Every number I wore he tried to wear it. I wore it first. I wore 24 first.” Catchings wore 24 from her rookie season in 2001-02 whereas Bryant only switched to it in 2006. She also wore the number 10 for the national team a few years before Kobe wore it.

Mandatory Credit: Grace Hollars-USA TODAY Sports Is the Caitlin Clark hate real? Despite Becky Hammon sending out a clear message that no one in the league hates Clark, the game between Las Vegas Aces and Indiana Fever had a quite a controversial moment. During a rather one-sided game, the reigning Sixth Player of the Year Alysha Clark inadvertently hit Clark hard on the face while trying to block her shot. During the initial minutes of the second quarter of the game between Indiana and Las Vegas tonight, Caitlin Clark drove to the basket for a layup but couldn’t create enough separation between herself and the defender, Alysha Clark. It resulted in the Aces guard stripping the ball away from the Iowa icon. However, Alysha also smacked the 22-year-old in the eye. While at first glance, it didn’t look too dangerous, replays suggested otherwise. As a result, the 3x WNBA champion picked a quick whistle for a personal foul and Clark went to the strip for a couple of free throws. While it did not look anything like an intentional hit, the Aces guard ran away from the crime scene in disbelief. Although Clark continued playing for the Fever, the Aces prevented the rookie from showing off her skills. She only scored 8 points and 5 rebounds with a game-high 7 assists.

Mandatory Credit: Kevin Jairaj-USA TODAY Sports The game ended with a 99-80 win for the Aces but the Caitlin Clark incident became the talking point. When she arrived in the league, there were rumors that some of the veterans weren’t happy because of the attention that was given to Clark. Clark generated high viewership numbers during her college career and as such she is expected to do the same in WNBA. But the physical nature of the league has been quite a challenge. As Clark and other rookies were preparing for the draft this year, WNBA legend Diana Taurasi had a warning for them. “Reality is coming, there’s levels to this thing. You look superhuman playing against some 18 years olds but you’re going to come play with some grown women that have been playing professional basketball for a long time.” Clark has realized that the WNBA is a step up from college basketball in terms of the physicality on display. She has acknowledged the increased physicality and speed after a first few games. “The physicality is definitely up there. I’m easily pushed off screens… The game seems a little fast for me right now.” So far Clark has done alright as she averages 17.8 points per game and 5.8 assists, but she has struggled with turnovers, averaging 5.8 per game and her shooting percentages have also dipped. Still, in light of what happened with Alysha Clark in the recent game, fans are not happy and believe that there is a deliberate attempt to stifle the rookie class on WNBA by the veterans. Indiana has a very young core that has struggled to keep up with the physicality of the league with six defeats and one win this season. However, what happened tonight has turned the focus on whether being physical should translate into hurting the opponent. One YT user stood up for all the 2024 rookies. They commented, “The hate for this rookie class has to be studied.” Another YT user called out the “old players” for their behavior towards the rookies. Tonight, Caitlin Clark was not the only one on the receiving end of the physical nature of the W as Angel Reese was also thrown to the ground in her game. The Player of the Week in the Eastern Conference, Alyssa Thomas, dragged the rookie down by her neck. Although the Chi-Town Barbie only praised the vet, fans are not okay with what is going on against the talented 2024 batch. “This old players are disgusting, happened during Sun game too, also Thomas, took down Reece by the neck.” The NBA GOATs have been standing up for Caitlin Clark ever since she was in college and received attention. Recently, LeBron James commented on how the rookie is the sole reason for all the great changes in the W. Sir Charles and Magic Johnson also followed that up. They praised Clark for all her contributions to the evolution of the league. In fact, Charles Barkley addressed the treatment that has been meted out to Clark and called it “petty.” Speaking during the TV coverage of NBA playoffs Barkley said, “Y’all petty, girls. Y’all should be thanking that girl for getting y’all a** private charters. All the money and visibility she’s bringing to the WNBA; don’t be petty like dudes. What she’s accomplished, give her her flowers.” Hence, one Clark fan brought up how Charles Barkley had called all the ‘hateful’ WNBA veterans “Charles Barkley: Stop being petty.” Earlier Aces coach said Becky Hammon said there was no animosity towards Clark from the league. She said, “This narrative of everybody hating on Caitlin Clark, and even the black and white thing, knock it off. It’s not there. It’s not there. Shut down the noise.” But the Aysha Clark incident does raise a few questions. A basketball follower also brought up the fact that after the follow-through hit, Alysha Clark pranced out of the paint. And even if the smack was not intentional, the way she laughed off of the area made the entire situation look strange. Later, Kelsey Plum too bent down while trying to hide her laugh after this case. So, whether it was intended or not, we cannot say for sure. But did the whistle for a foul make the right decision? Pretty much so. “That was a deliberate hit from the way she was prancing afterwards.” ADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad Parallels between Michael Jordan and Caitlin Clark are not new. In the W, her huge deal with Nike and Wilson has stirred up the air with comparisons. And while none of the players have spoken about it, fans are not stopping with it. Hence, one YT user reminded the previously honored “Stephen Curry of women’s basketball” that she is the MJ of the women’s league. They also told the rookie to know the hate but also to continue raising the bar. “Cc remember this they are hatein on you ….Your MJ of this woman’s league…So take the hits get in the gym and stay balling girl.” It won’t be surprising to see the NCAA all-time leading scorer getting more such hits in the coming weeks and months. Next, the Fever will host the LA Sparks in their home arena. It will be interesting to see if they can hand the visitors another defeat and grab their second win of the season. Fans will hope that Clark will be the talking point of the upcoming match but for all the right reasons.

Center. Mandatory Credit: Wendell Cruz-USA TODAY Sports Did Team USA drop the ball by ignoring Caitlin Clark's marketing potential? Less than 24 hours after Team USA’s men’s basketball team handed France a defeat in the finals, the women’s team did the same. They defeated the host nation by a narrow 67-66 margin on Sunday to claim their eighth consecutive gold at the Olympics. Despite these efforts and achievements, Stephen A. Smith believes, “Team USA missed an opportunity,” and he’s not apologetic for saying this. On August 13th, Smith unveiled his perspective via his official YouTube channel. “When you talk about marketing the sport, I think Team USA missed an opportunity to elevate the profile of women’s excellence in the sport of basketball because they ignored marketing,” he said after applauding Team USA’s women for returning with their eighth consecutive gold around their necks. For Smith, Caitlin Clark was an opportunity Team USA could have seized. Her addition to Team USA would have been a marketing boost. “Box office matters… we want to act like it doesn’t matter, but it does,” he added. For context, 4 of Team USA’s games over the past week drew an audience of less than 13,000. Meanwhile, the Indiana Fever alone recorded about 16,898 viewers per game for 11 straight since Clark’s arrival. ADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad He even pointed out how the men’s basketball team is taking advantage of marketing opportunities. “It’s not an accident I saw Anthony Edwards with those Adidas shoes, or LeBron James with his gold-plated shoes, but I saw that. Adidas took advantage of the marketing opportunity. LeBron took advantage of the marketing opportunity. It matters,” he added. Quite evidently, Smith seems to be right. But how has Caitlin Clark’s omission from Team USA affected her? Did Team USA just make the biggest mistake by snubbing Caitlin Clark? React! Reactions ADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad Well, it did affect her, but in a good way. In fact, it turned out to be a blessing in disguise. “I honestly can’t wait to not touch a basketball for a while,” she told The Athletic after the WNBA All-Star matchup. Most of the rookies who share similar hype haven’t had the privilege of a break. But Clark made the most of the WNBA’s 24-day Olympic break, vacationing in Mexico with her teammates and attending India State Fair. “I think relaxing and reflecting on everything that’s happened to me over the course of the last year is going to be super important because my life has moved so fast,” she added. Above all, she finally got time to relax after March 2023. Now that it’s time to return, she might have reanalyzed her WNBA rookie season, which is extremely important in the Rookie of the Year race. Her first game after the Olympics break will be against Pheonix Mercury on 17th August. What do you think? Will she be stronger and better this time?

Well, she might not travel outside the country, but she’s definitely heading somewhere after capping off her rookie season. Joining illustrious names like Kelsey Plum, Rhyne Howard, Chelsea Gray, Arike Ogunbowale, and more in the 3v3 Basketball venture introduced by the former UConn pair of Breanna Stewart and Napheesa Collier, Reese is heading to Miami this summer. Providing insight into queries regarding Reese’s involvement was the Minnesota Lynx power forward Collier. The 4x WNBA All-Star responded to one such question on X recently. She tweets, “Angel is a business woman & knows the power of ownership. This is the one investment as basketball players we can control.

Join Debate Anyhow, Reese is not the only young basketball sensation headlining the league. By the looks of it, another Husky in the form of Paige Bueckers has agreed to become the only college basketball face participating in such an event. As it turns out, this will be a part of the NIL deal that promises her ownership equity. Although, Bueckers would be representing an Unrivaled team only after she completes her rookie season in the WNBA. The instrumental reason why a WNBA athlete has to go overseas in their off-season is because their WNBA salaries are just not enough. However, things are expected to take a positive turn in this regard as soon as the league’s new $2.2B media rights deal is implemented. Until then, Unrivaled is expected to do the job. Perhaps this is what Angel Reese also believes as she provides further clarification on her latest development. The 2024 WNBA All-Star on her recent media availability day spilled some beans on her latest engagement. Seemingly, she was asked as to what made it a compelling case for her to become a part of the league. To which she responds, “I think it’s amazing. Who wouldn’t want to play with two great players like that? And I knew they were gonna bring on a couple more dogs”.  ADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad Soon after, the ferocious Chicago No.5 opened up about the financial aspect of this collaboration. She further adds, “Being able to make — what? — six figures. Being able to make six figures here within three months. Just being able to get better. Three-on-three exposes everything. So, I’m excited for it”.  According to trusted sources, the league will be pumping a whopping  $7.5 million. That ensures an average of $250,000 for each participant. This figure is the highest in the history of women’s professional sports leagues. Meanwhile, the most a WNBA athlete makes in a year is $241,000. This exciting venture will be launching in January next year. Witnessing so much talent on the same stage is sure to provide a lot of entertainment for the fans.

12,Diamond DeShields,"The flyest AAU team: Antonio Davis as coach, Ken Griffey Jr.'s daughter, two WNBA Finals players and a whole lot of winning",https://theathletic.com/2885337/2021/10/15/the-flyest-aau-team-antonio-davis-as-coach-ken-griffey-jr-s-daughter-two-wnba-finals-players-and-a-whole-lot-of-winning/,"Editor’s Note: This story is included in The Athletic’s Best of 2021. View the full list. Clap-clap…clap. Yup! Clap-clap…clap. Yup! Ahh. The familiar sound in AAU gyms all over the country as Soulja Boy’s “Donk” rang out while the clock wound down in warmups. It was 2007. I was 12 years old and preparing to play my first AAU game as a member of the Georgia Ice. Clap-clap…clap. NOPE! Clap-clap … clap. NOPE! My AAU team had remixed the smash hit to let our opponents know, as regulation ended and we were locking up yet another victory, that we were not some random team to be taken lightly. Advertisement I walked out to the parking lot with my parents after the game to see our opponents angrily shoving their keys into ignitions and driving off. “Whoa,” I thought. “They’re old enough to drive?” We had beaten a U17 team in our first action together, and that’s when I knew: This team was very different. It was the start of my youth basketball career with several future WNBA players who just happened to be the daughters of superstar professional athletes. Baseball greats Ken Griffey Jr. and Delino DeShields, and NBA stars like Dee Brown, Antonio Davis and Kevin Whitted along with a slew of other former Division I athletes, had children on my AAU teams destined to follow in their athletic footsteps. My dad? He was a paralegal. We were regular tweens who had silly sleepovers. The difference? Those were sometimes hosted at the Griffey’s massive mansion. We flew first class to an AAU championship. We came from different backgrounds, but we fit well together. And we made up the flyest AAU girls basketball team around. Years later, it’s Lexie Brown and Diamond DeShields who have most closely followed in their dads’ athletic footsteps. They’re teammates again with the Chicago Sky, playing in the WNBA Finals against the Phoenix Mercury. “Time just kind of separates you,” Diamond said when we caught up recently. “We went to college and then life happens. And so being here now, I think it reminds us both how much we need each other.” how it started:              how it’s going: pic.twitter.com/eB4fqSHIP1 — Lexie Brown (@Lexiebrown) June 3, 2021  “I don’t know why all of a sudden the universe brought us back together, but without us building our relationship back then, I probably wouldn’t be on this team right now,” Lexie said. In the winter of 2007, I was warming up to play for St. Pius X Catholic High School in Metro Atlanta when a tall, lanky 6-foot-something girl walked into the gym with her much-taller, much-lankier father. I didn’t pay it too much mind. Just barely 5-foot, everyone was taller than me. What I didn’t expect, though, was having to guard her. Advertisement I did my best and held my own, which was apparently enough for a post-game handshake from the lanky point guard and her proud papa. I’d learn that the girl was Kaela Davis and that her father was former NBA player Antonio Davis. They had moved from Chicago to Atlanta and were looking to start an AAU team. My family and I drove back home freaking out. I had always been a scrappy little something, but I never imagined catching the eye of an NBA player. Even though my team had been defeated, no one in the gym could deny that the smallest person on the court was at least the second best player that day. “I actually didn’t want to coach at all, just because I’m not good at cutting kids,” Davis told me when we caught up this week. “But it was right around the time I was retiring so everything kind of fell into place.” At the tryout, I noticed everybody was so tall. And I wasn’t. Which was normal. But these girls were all really tall. “Coach Antonio” put us through one of the most intense workouts I’d ever been through. My dad was there with me. He had coached my former AAU team before that team split up. I made it through the workout, holding my own against undoubtedly the best girls my age in the state of Georgia. Davis called my parents a couple days later asking if I would like to be a member of the Georgia Ice, his new girls’ basketball team. I remember jumping on Google, maybe on my iPod touch, and typing “Antonio Davis.” Whoa. He played for the Bulls and Pacers. He played against — no way! — Michael Jordan. “Welcome to the Space Jam” must have been playing in my mind. That movie was the reason I started playing basketball. Now I’m a degree of separation from Jordan? Davis invited the team to his house to get to know each other. I use the term “house” loosely. A movie theater, a game room, a pool, a basketball court. The elevator was the thing that blew my mind. I had never seen anything like it. Advertisement Before I knew it, I was over there pretty often. It was the coolest thing ever to me. And our team was talented in equal measure. One of our first tournaments was at Georgia Tech. We all arrived at the gym early to change into our bright orange and light blue uniforms. Georgia Ice. We were the first AAU team that I remember to wear Nike Elite socks. We had our names on the back of our jerseys, our numbers on the sides of our shoes. We qualified for the national championships pretty early in the AAU season. My family and I had never flown before. Davis bought the entire team first-class tickets. We were a bunch of 12-year-old girls in first class having the time of our lives on an NBA superstar’s dime. We won the 12U National Championship in 2008. “I was really just looking for girls with raw talent, to teach them to play the right way,” Davis said. “I always wanted to practice more than I wanted to play but we just ended up getting really good.” Things got really interesting the next year. Every girl playing basketball in the area at the time wanted to play for the Georgia Ice. I was about 1,000 times more nervous at this tryout. And boy, were there some superstars in the gym: Kaela Davis (Anthony’s daughter), Lexie Brown (Dee’s daughter), Taryn Griffey (Ken’s daughter), Diamond DeShields (Delino’s daughter). The fact that so many famous fathers had come together to form this girl-dad super team was unheard of at the time. This was pre-“girl dad” era. But they learned from an early age about teamwork and work ethic. “I think the vibe that we put out really just attracted more dads and daughters who really wanted to learn how to play the game the right way,” Davis said. “The craziest thing for me was that Ken Griffey Jrs., Dee Browns and others of the world trusted me with their daughters and this process.” Lexie and Kaela grew up together when Davis and Dee Brown played together for the Toronto Raptors. Lexie and Taryn Griffey later played on the same AAU team in Orlando while we were forming the Georgia Ice in Atlanta. Their moms became friends and the girls played on the same team, meaning Lexie and Taryn attended school in Orlando during the week and then drove or flew to Atlanta on the weekends to compete with the Georgia Ice. Advertisement Diamond, on the other hand, was like me. Her AAU team had disbanded and she was looking for an AAU home. We had played against each other several times growing up. Our teams had a bit of an U11 rivalry, if there was such a thing at that age. “At that point, I knew who I wanted to play with. I said, I’m going to play with them,” Diamond said. Brown called the Georgia Ice a “super team.” “None of that was actually planned,” Davis said. “When we had the opportunity to add someone like Diamond DeShields, I didn’t know if she was going to be a good fit. I knew she was extremely athletic and had all the tools, I just didn’t know if she was going to mesh with our team. But each and every girl that came our way just ended up being the perfect piece.” We’d grow together as a team and as young women over the course of that season under the guidance of the GOAT dads. Having Davis lead us reminded me a lot of when my dad coached me, but I often wondered how it was to have a superstar dad. And to have to perform in front of him. It formed a bond among players. “For me, just the fact that Kaela, Lexie, Peyton (Whitted) and Taryn all had parents who were pros,” Diamond said, “I got to interact with kids that kind of grew up the same way as I did in that aspect. It was cool.” Lexie said: “I think that’s why me and Diamond have been able to bond and stay close over the years because we have very similar upbringings, and we can appreciate that about each other.” Those sleepovers, though, were something. In our second year together, the AAU national championships were conveniently held in Orlando, where Taryn and Lexie lived. While our parents went back to their hotel rooms after games, the whole team spent the weekend at the Griffeys’ house. I remember one couch so big all 15 of us slept on it comfortably. Advertisement Sometimes we’d be in hotel lobbies after games and the dad’s traded stories from Griffey’s greatest hits to Davis’ time playing against Jordan. My family would sit in awe. In time, we all grew pretty close. “It just became like a family,” Lexie said. We’d spend our time watching the YouTube videos that were going “viral” at the time. We liked to create our own content back then — before it was trendy. ‘We were doing viral shit before viral was a thing,” said DeShields. In the summer of 2009, we traveled to Virginia for the Boo Williams Invitational. As the starting point guard, I suffered an ACL injury that Lexie says changed the course of her career, giving her more time at the position. (I don’t know if I can agree with that given her talent!) “It was Diamond’s coming out party for us for sure,” said Lexie. Every D1 women’s basketball coach you could think of lined the sidelines to watch us work. The “greatest show on ice,” as we were called, was as popular as it had ever been, coming off of two AAU national championships and garnering elite-level college looks. Olympic gold medalist Allisha Gray eventually joined the team as well. The good times would eventually end as they always have to. We’d all go on to focus on playing for our high school teams. I went to Collins Hill High School and had the pleasure of getting my brains beat in over the next four years by Diamond at Norcross High and Lexie at North Gwinnett. We began to compete against each other more than we played together. Priorities became different for some. I, for example, was now quite certain that I was not going to play professionally, and was just hoping to secure a scholarship. I eventually signed to play Division II basketball at the University of Montevallo in Alabama. Lexie committed to Maryland, Diamond to North Carolina, Kaela and Allisha to South Carolina,  Peyton Whitted to Penn State, Kristina Nelson to Notre Dame and Kylee Smith to Belmont. Advertisement From there, life did its thing. Lexie transferred to Duke to finish. Diamond to Tennessee. Kaela and Allisha won a national championship with Dawn Staley. I transferred to the University of West Georgia. Allison was drafted fourth in 2017 by the Dallas Wings. Kaela went to Dallas as well, a few picks later at No. 10. Diamond was drafted No. 3 overall by the Chicago Sky in 2018. Lexie would be a few picks behind at No. 9 to the Connecticut Sun. After playing in Hungary for a season, Lexie was traded to the Minnesota Lynx where she played a significant role coming off of the bench for two seasons before injuries slowed her momentum heading into the bubble. Lexie was waived by Chicago after training camp earlier this season before she was brought back and signed permanently. She said her rekindled friendship with Diamond helped her feel comfortable joining the Sky. “Yeah, getting to Chicago, for me, was like a hot ass mess,” she said. “You know, me and Diamond’s relationship actually wasn’t the greatest in college. “I was out of the league this year for three weeks, so it’s really hard to get in. It’s even harder to stay in. Having the relationships with the right people and you have to carry yourself professionally; you can find a way back, and Diamond was a huge part of that.” if you told us we would be finishing a WNBA season together….we wouldn’t have even believed it 😭❤️ pic.twitter.com/hchwpsm6Yr — Lexie Brown (@Lexiebrown) September 19, 2021  They played for different teams in the “Wubble” last season and didn’t talk. When Diamond suffered an injury, Lexie’s mom encouraged her to reach out. “My mom was just like, I think she needs you back in her life,” Brown said. “I was like, ‘Nah, she’s fine.’ But, I invited her over for Thanksgiving. I was still with Minnesota at the time, but I was already feeling weird about that situation. She was like, yeah you should just come play with us in Chicago. James loves your game and I would love for you to be there.” Advertisement Lexie felt comfortable in Minnesota at the time but had Diamond put in a good word with Chicago. Lexie and the Lynx eventually parted ways at the end of 2020. “Chicago was the first team that called my agent,” she said. “They were trying to trade for me during free agency and they just couldn’t. I think that everything was a blessing in disguise.” Even as kids winning titles together, Lexie and Diamond didn’t dream about playing for a professional championship. “Being this close now, to possibly getting to the WNBA Finals together … which is a conversation neither one of us have ever had together,” Lexie said. Chicago, the No. 6 seed, is in the finals for the first time since 2014. The Sky play Game 3 Friday in Chicago with the series against Phoenix tied 1-1. The possibility of winning a championship together — as adults now — becomes more real every day for both Lexie and Diamond. “Even when Diamond was a little younger, she had doubts,” Lexie says. “She had self-doubt about her even getting to the WNBA. That was a shocking revelation to me. I remember when we all walked into the gym at 13 years old and thinking, ‘Wow. These guys are going to the league and I am not.’” We had played against each other for so long but I don’t ever remember Diamond being a no-name. So when she came in, I already knew she was like that. Seeing them achieve all these years later makes our childhood memories all the sweeter. Looking back, we were good teen players. Now we see it as the start of successful basketball careers for some. “I know when I walked in I was like, oh, this is a different level of tough,” Diamond said. “Like, oh man, I’m going to take what I can here,” DeShields said. “I thought everybody was just equally tough. I just saw everybody as an equal. At that point, I felt like we were all the best 13-year-olds on the planet.” Looking back, I think we were.

13,Diamond DeShields,"The flyest AAU team: Antonio Davis as coach, Ken Griffey Jr.'s daughter, two WNBA Finals players and a whole lot of winning",https://theathletic.com/2885337/2021/10/15/the-flyest-aau-team-antonio-davis-as-coach-ken-griffey-jr-s-daughter-two-wnba-finals-players-and-a-whole-lot-of-winning/,"Editor’s Note: This story is included in The Athletic’s Best of 2021. View the full list. Clap-clap…clap. Yup! Clap-clap…clap. Yup! Ahh. The familiar sound in AAU gyms all over the country as Soulja Boy’s “Donk” rang out while the clock wound down in warmups. It was 2007. I was 12 years old and preparing to play my first AAU game as a member of the Georgia Ice. Clap-clap…clap. NOPE! Clap-clap … clap. NOPE! My AAU team had remixed the smash hit to let our opponents know, as regulation ended and we were locking up yet another victory, that we were not some random team to be taken lightly. Advertisement I walked out to the parking lot with my parents after the game to see our opponents angrily shoving their keys into ignitions and driving off. “Whoa,” I thought. “They’re old enough to drive?” We had beaten a U17 team in our first action together, and that’s when I knew: This team was very different. It was the start of my youth basketball career with several future WNBA players who just happened to be the daughters of superstar professional athletes. Baseball greats Ken Griffey Jr. and Delino DeShields, and NBA stars like Dee Brown, Antonio Davis and Kevin Whitted along with a slew of other former Division I athletes, had children on my AAU teams destined to follow in their athletic footsteps. My dad? He was a paralegal. We were regular tweens who had silly sleepovers. The difference? Those were sometimes hosted at the Griffey’s massive mansion. We flew first class to an AAU championship. We came from different backgrounds, but we fit well together. And we made up the flyest AAU girls basketball team around. Years later, it’s Lexie Brown and Diamond DeShields who have most closely followed in their dads’ athletic footsteps. They’re teammates again with the Chicago Sky, playing in the WNBA Finals against the Phoenix Mercury. “Time just kind of separates you,” Diamond said when we caught up recently. “We went to college and then life happens. And so being here now, I think it reminds us both how much we need each other.” how it started:              how it’s going: pic.twitter.com/eB4fqSHIP1 — Lexie Brown (@Lexiebrown) June 3, 2021  “I don’t know why all of a sudden the universe brought us back together, but without us building our relationship back then, I probably wouldn’t be on this team right now,” Lexie said. In the winter of 2007, I was warming up to play for St. Pius X Catholic High School in Metro Atlanta when a tall, lanky 6-foot-something girl walked into the gym with her much-taller, much-lankier father. I didn’t pay it too much mind. Just barely 5-foot, everyone was taller than me. What I didn’t expect, though, was having to guard her. Advertisement I did my best and held my own, which was apparently enough for a post-game handshake from the lanky point guard and her proud papa. I’d learn that the girl was Kaela Davis and that her father was former NBA player Antonio Davis. They had moved from Chicago to Atlanta and were looking to start an AAU team. My family and I drove back home freaking out. I had always been a scrappy little something, but I never imagined catching the eye of an NBA player. Even though my team had been defeated, no one in the gym could deny that the smallest person on the court was at least the second best player that day. “I actually didn’t want to coach at all, just because I’m not good at cutting kids,” Davis told me when we caught up this week. “But it was right around the time I was retiring so everything kind of fell into place.” At the tryout, I noticed everybody was so tall. And I wasn’t. Which was normal. But these girls were all really tall. “Coach Antonio” put us through one of the most intense workouts I’d ever been through. My dad was there with me. He had coached my former AAU team before that team split up. I made it through the workout, holding my own against undoubtedly the best girls my age in the state of Georgia. Davis called my parents a couple days later asking if I would like to be a member of the Georgia Ice, his new girls’ basketball team. I remember jumping on Google, maybe on my iPod touch, and typing “Antonio Davis.” Whoa. He played for the Bulls and Pacers. He played against — no way! — Michael Jordan. “Welcome to the Space Jam” must have been playing in my mind. That movie was the reason I started playing basketball. Now I’m a degree of separation from Jordan? Davis invited the team to his house to get to know each other. I use the term “house” loosely. A movie theater, a game room, a pool, a basketball court. The elevator was the thing that blew my mind. I had never seen anything like it. Advertisement Before I knew it, I was over there pretty often. It was the coolest thing ever to me. And our team was talented in equal measure. One of our first tournaments was at Georgia Tech. We all arrived at the gym early to change into our bright orange and light blue uniforms. Georgia Ice. We were the first AAU team that I remember to wear Nike Elite socks. We had our names on the back of our jerseys, our numbers on the sides of our shoes. We qualified for the national championships pretty early in the AAU season. My family and I had never flown before. Davis bought the entire team first-class tickets. We were a bunch of 12-year-old girls in first class having the time of our lives on an NBA superstar’s dime. We won the 12U National Championship in 2008. “I was really just looking for girls with raw talent, to teach them to play the right way,” Davis said. “I always wanted to practice more than I wanted to play but we just ended up getting really good.” Things got really interesting the next year. Every girl playing basketball in the area at the time wanted to play for the Georgia Ice. I was about 1,000 times more nervous at this tryout. And boy, were there some superstars in the gym: Kaela Davis (Anthony’s daughter), Lexie Brown (Dee’s daughter), Taryn Griffey (Ken’s daughter), Diamond DeShields (Delino’s daughter). The fact that so many famous fathers had come together to form this girl-dad super team was unheard of at the time. This was pre-“girl dad” era. But they learned from an early age about teamwork and work ethic. “I think the vibe that we put out really just attracted more dads and daughters who really wanted to learn how to play the game the right way,” Davis said. “The craziest thing for me was that Ken Griffey Jrs., Dee Browns and others of the world trusted me with their daughters and this process.” Lexie and Kaela grew up together when Davis and Dee Brown played together for the Toronto Raptors. Lexie and Taryn Griffey later played on the same AAU team in Orlando while we were forming the Georgia Ice in Atlanta. Their moms became friends and the girls played on the same team, meaning Lexie and Taryn attended school in Orlando during the week and then drove or flew to Atlanta on the weekends to compete with the Georgia Ice. Advertisement Diamond, on the other hand, was like me. Her AAU team had disbanded and she was looking for an AAU home. We had played against each other several times growing up. Our teams had a bit of an U11 rivalry, if there was such a thing at that age. “At that point, I knew who I wanted to play with. I said, I’m going to play with them,” Diamond said. Brown called the Georgia Ice a “super team.” “None of that was actually planned,” Davis said. “When we had the opportunity to add someone like Diamond DeShields, I didn’t know if she was going to be a good fit. I knew she was extremely athletic and had all the tools, I just didn’t know if she was going to mesh with our team. But each and every girl that came our way just ended up being the perfect piece.” We’d grow together as a team and as young women over the course of that season under the guidance of the GOAT dads. Having Davis lead us reminded me a lot of when my dad coached me, but I often wondered how it was to have a superstar dad. And to have to perform in front of him. It formed a bond among players. “For me, just the fact that Kaela, Lexie, Peyton (Whitted) and Taryn all had parents who were pros,” Diamond said, “I got to interact with kids that kind of grew up the same way as I did in that aspect. It was cool.” Lexie said: “I think that’s why me and Diamond have been able to bond and stay close over the years because we have very similar upbringings, and we can appreciate that about each other.” Those sleepovers, though, were something. In our second year together, the AAU national championships were conveniently held in Orlando, where Taryn and Lexie lived. While our parents went back to their hotel rooms after games, the whole team spent the weekend at the Griffeys’ house. I remember one couch so big all 15 of us slept on it comfortably. Advertisement Sometimes we’d be in hotel lobbies after games and the dad’s traded stories from Griffey’s greatest hits to Davis’ time playing against Jordan. My family would sit in awe. In time, we all grew pretty close. “It just became like a family,” Lexie said. We’d spend our time watching the YouTube videos that were going “viral” at the time. We liked to create our own content back then — before it was trendy. ‘We were doing viral shit before viral was a thing,” said DeShields. In the summer of 2009, we traveled to Virginia for the Boo Williams Invitational. As the starting point guard, I suffered an ACL injury that Lexie says changed the course of her career, giving her more time at the position. (I don’t know if I can agree with that given her talent!) “It was Diamond’s coming out party for us for sure,” said Lexie. Every D1 women’s basketball coach you could think of lined the sidelines to watch us work. The “greatest show on ice,” as we were called, was as popular as it had ever been, coming off of two AAU national championships and garnering elite-level college looks. Olympic gold medalist Allisha Gray eventually joined the team as well. The good times would eventually end as they always have to. We’d all go on to focus on playing for our high school teams. I went to Collins Hill High School and had the pleasure of getting my brains beat in over the next four years by Diamond at Norcross High and Lexie at North Gwinnett. We began to compete against each other more than we played together. Priorities became different for some. I, for example, was now quite certain that I was not going to play professionally, and was just hoping to secure a scholarship. I eventually signed to play Division II basketball at the University of Montevallo in Alabama. Lexie committed to Maryland, Diamond to North Carolina, Kaela and Allisha to South Carolina,  Peyton Whitted to Penn State, Kristina Nelson to Notre Dame and Kylee Smith to Belmont. Advertisement From there, life did its thing. Lexie transferred to Duke to finish. Diamond to Tennessee. Kaela and Allisha won a national championship with Dawn Staley. I transferred to the University of West Georgia. Allison was drafted fourth in 2017 by the Dallas Wings. Kaela went to Dallas as well, a few picks later at No. 10. Diamond was drafted No. 3 overall by the Chicago Sky in 2018. Lexie would be a few picks behind at No. 9 to the Connecticut Sun. After playing in Hungary for a season, Lexie was traded to the Minnesota Lynx where she played a significant role coming off of the bench for two seasons before injuries slowed her momentum heading into the bubble. Lexie was waived by Chicago after training camp earlier this season before she was brought back and signed permanently. She said her rekindled friendship with Diamond helped her feel comfortable joining the Sky. “Yeah, getting to Chicago, for me, was like a hot ass mess,” she said. “You know, me and Diamond’s relationship actually wasn’t the greatest in college. “I was out of the league this year for three weeks, so it’s really hard to get in. It’s even harder to stay in. Having the relationships with the right people and you have to carry yourself professionally; you can find a way back, and Diamond was a huge part of that.” if you told us we would be finishing a WNBA season together….we wouldn’t have even believed it 😭❤️ pic.twitter.com/hchwpsm6Yr — Lexie Brown (@Lexiebrown) September 19, 2021  They played for different teams in the “Wubble” last season and didn’t talk. When Diamond suffered an injury, Lexie’s mom encouraged her to reach out. “My mom was just like, I think she needs you back in her life,” Brown said. “I was like, ‘Nah, she’s fine.’ But, I invited her over for Thanksgiving. I was still with Minnesota at the time, but I was already feeling weird about that situation. She was like, yeah you should just come play with us in Chicago. James loves your game and I would love for you to be there.” Advertisement Lexie felt comfortable in Minnesota at the time but had Diamond put in a good word with Chicago. Lexie and the Lynx eventually parted ways at the end of 2020. “Chicago was the first team that called my agent,” she said. “They were trying to trade for me during free agency and they just couldn’t.

14,Aaliyah Edwards,Canadian star Aaliyah Edwards proud to be part of a growing community of women's basketball,https://www.cbc.ca/sports/aaliyah-edwards-opinion-shireen-ahmed-1.7187965,"As the WNBA begins training camps this week, the excitement of new stars rising is in the air and on the court. The MedStar Performance Center in Washington, D.C. is the practice facility of the Washington Mystics and Canadian basketball star Aaliyah Edwards's new team. The celebrated forward, who played her college ball at the University of Connecticut under storied women's coach Geno Auriemma, is being warmly welcomed her new city. She threw the first pitch at a Nationals MLB game and also helped lead cheers for the Washington Spirit, the local NWSL team. Born in Kingston, Ont., Edwards was recently drafted sixth overall by the Mystics in the WNBA draft. And in just a few months, the 21-year-old will head to France with the women's national team for the Paris Olympics.  This is a big years for Edwards, from making it to the Final Four with UConn in one of the top-viewed college basketball games in history, to being a top draft pick for the WNBA, to representing Canada on sports' biggest stage. Edwards said that since her freshman year, she has felt the growth of women's basketball, which she refers to as community.  ""I'm just so grateful to be a part of it and impacting it,"" she said with her wide trademark grin. ""I feel like I'm not only acknowledging those that came before me and just trying to keep pushing that way, pushing that momentum of bet on women, but also, you know, paving the way for those coming behind me. ""Because I'm kind of opening up new doors and opportunities for the next generation.""  WATCH: Edwards on inspiring the next generation: Edwards speaks with so much humility, despite her accomplishments and being so recognizable because of her bright yellow braids and the face mask she wears when she plays. Edwards broke her nose in 2022 and has worn the mask ever since. It hasn't affected her performance. She averaged 17.6 points per game, 9 rebounds, made 74 per cent of her free throws, finishing her NCAA with more than 1,000 points. She's tactical on defence and commits to the play and her team with such tremendous intensity and force. Those attributes and undeniable skills have put her on the map as she was named Most Improved Player and was a semifinalist in voting for the Naismith Player of the Year award. Her might on the court coupled with the face equipment reminds one of a young Christine Sinclair, who similarly had to protect her face after breaking her nose. And like Sinclair, Edwards holds her country and her family close to her heart.  During an interview at the draft, WNBA reporter Holly Rowe asked Edwards about what it means to her that Canada was cheering her on. Edwards emotionally acknowledged the efforts of her family, most particularly her mother who coached her. During her exchange with Rowe, which admittedly also had me in tears, Edwards said she was hopeful that in following in her footsteps, young players in Canada would make their own impact. I asked her about that moment. ""First of all, I'm not sure how many words I actually got out during my interview with Holly because I was crying and choking up through half of it,"" she said with a laugh. ""I said a little prayer, like, you know, God got me. I'm just appreciative of all the blessings he's given me leading up to this point. ""And [when WNBA commissioner Cathy Engelbert] called my name, that's when the tears went and the embrace with my family, each one of my family members, my teammates and also my college coaches there."" Her UConn teammates, including Paige Bueckers and Nika Muhl, stood cheering and filmed her entire draft moment like proud parents. The moment went viral. Edwards being so openly affected by the moment was touching. ""It was a lot of emotions, a lot of emotions for sure,"" she said. ""But I think it was … just relief. Like I've always dreamed of this moment of playing professional basketball and playing in the W. It was amazing."" Edwards feels that to be a part of the basketball community in Canada and be an advocate for it is important and necessary. She is fully aware of her position as a role model and showing young Canadian ballers how greatness lives here, too. The only downside Edwards admits to while being away from Canada is missing ketchup-flavoured chips (not available in the U.S.) and real maple syrup — two staples of the Canadian diet. ""I've tried to put my UConn team onto that,"" she said. ""I definitely miss that the most since I've been here. I'm trying to convert some people, so we'll see how that goes. "" National teammate Kia Nurse, a fellow UConn alum, said Edwards's impact has been felt on the national team from a young age. She debuted on the senior team at the Tokyo Olympics in 2021. Nurse predicts that Edwards will be a part of the Canadian team for a while. ""For us to have success on the world stage we have to have our best players,"" Nurse said. ""And Aaliyah is a big part of our group.""  As far as the expectations for these Olympics go, Edwards is ready to do whatever the team needs her to do. She had just completed her freshman year of college when she made her Olympic debut, but this time she feels more prepared in her mental game. ""My first Olympics, I was the youngest on the team, and I was kind of new to that whole play and in that whole Olympics environment,"" she said. ""I think now, understanding the process of actually qualifying for Olympics and going through all that with the senior women's national team, I understand the stakes of what each game comes to."" She plans to take her competitiveness and raise it to an Olympic level. Raising her game is something that Edwards does exceptionally well.  But not everything has been seamless for Edwards. In March, she was named as an Adidas athlete and joined the ranks of PWHL player Sarah Nurse, who promotes the global sports brand. But being Canadian and on a student visa, it prevented Edwards from utilizing the ""Name, Image and Likeness"" agreement in the U.S. As an international student, she was only permitted to benefit in a ""passive way"" from her agreement and that meant not being able to speak of it publically while in school, which can be confusing to navigate with an often relentless sports media asking questions. Now, as a professional player, Edwards can actively promote being part of the Adidas brand, which will also amplify her popularity. Edwards feels it's a sign that her circle is expanding and she ""feels the love."" Being part of that elite group is like a sisterhood, she explained. She feels this next step aligns with her values and she's proud because the other athletes are like-minded. ""Just to be surrounded by competitive, driven women … it's just great for me,"" she said. Although she hasn't had a chance to speak with Nurse face-to-face, Nurse did send her some messages. Edwards is cognizant of the ones who are already there, just ahead of her and how she can lean on them and ask questions for guidance. ""Not necessarily compare myself to,"" she said, ""but just kind of elevate to the level that they're at."" There's no doubt Edwards is ready for the next chapter. Her family and community have poured into her and it shows. I can't wait to see her star rise, hopefully with a hint of maple syrup attached.

Stacey Wescott/Chicago Tribune Chicago Sky guard Dana Evans poses with her new Jordan Luka 2 player edition shoes, ""The Intro,"" at the team's practice gym Thursday, Sept. 7, 2023, in Deerfield. Stacey Wescott/Chicago Tribune Chicago Sky guard Dana Evans poses with her new Jordan Luka 2 player edition shoes, ""The Intro,"" at the team's practice gym Thursday, Sept. 7, 2023, in Deerfield. Stacey Wescott/Chicago Tribune The tongues of Dana Evans' new shoes feature Evans' logo on the right and Luka Doncic's on the left. Stacey Wescott/Chicago Tribune The laces on Dana Evans' new shoes are made to look like DNA strands to represent her family. The insole of Dana Evans' new shoes features a cougar in honor of her high school, Gary West Side. Chicago Sky guard Dana Evans remembers when her love of sneakers began.While playing basketball in elementary school, she found herself attracted to “funky colors” that didn’t match her uniform.“I like to stand out on the court. I’ve always been like that,” she told the Tribune. “My favorite pair that started me on the path of being different was probably customizing my Nike Hyperdunks in all pink.”Evans’ love of sneakers will reach a new height in the Sky’s final regular-season home game Friday against the Minnesota Lynx at Wintrust Arena. She will debut her Jordan Luka 2 player edition (PE) shoe, “The Intro,” a special colorway made for Evans of Dallas Mavericks star Luka Doncic’s second signature shoe. To celebrate the occasion, the first 400 fans will receive a sky blue T-shirt with Evans’ DE11 logo.For Evans, the  shoe is a dream come true.“It means a lot because I like to express myself on the court, whether that’s just having my nails, lashes or hair done, and now I’m able to do it through a shoe,” she said. “I’ve always loved shoes. Being able to express myself within a shoe is pretty dope.”Evans, whose sneaker fashion is documented on the Instagram account DanaEvansKicks, signed with Jordan Brand last year and was the first Chicago athlete — male or female — to sign with the NBA legend’s sneaker imprint.“Dana overall embodies exactly what we like to see in our athletes,” Jasmine Jordan, a field representative in the Jordan Brand sports marketing division and the daughter of Michael Jordan, told the Tribune.

“When you look at Dana, you don’t think that she’s about to be taking you to the hole and cutting you and pulling back and hitting her jumpers. She’s so skilled and so agile for being so small, and it’s something that stuck out.”One of more than 10 WNBA athletes signed to the brand, Evans is part of a movement to push women to the forefront of sneaker culture. She believes it’s important for female athletes to be visible within the space.
The laces on Dana Evans’ new shoes are made to look like DNA strands to represent her family.“To put ourselves out in that aspect is bringing more viewers, and having more eyes on us is important,” she said. “We’ve talked a lot about that in the WNBA. Just having us being seen means people can relate to us and understand us more through different things.”New York Liberty star Sabrina Ionescu’s signature shoe, the Nike Sabrina 1, was released earlier this month. Washington Mystics forward Elena Delle Donne is the only other current female athlete to have a signature sneaker with the brand.It’s a move Gregory Jones II of G2 Hoops, Evans’ marketing agent, says will have an impact on the league for years to come.“Sabrina’s shoe is probably going to outpace some of the guys that had their first signature shoe,” Jones said. “It shows that there is a lane in the market for women to have signature shoes and PEs. It gives us the opportunity to say that women in the WNBA can sell sneakers, and what that turns into is being able to pay them more as far as their revenue share in that space.”In addition to Evans, Sky players Kahleah Copper, Ruthy Hebard and Elizabeth Williams (Adidas), Isabelle Harrison (Jordan), Marina Mabrey (Under Armour) and Courtney Williams (Moolah Kicks) have sneaker deals.
Chicago Sky guard Dana Evans poses with her new Jordan Luka 2 player edition shoes, “The Intro,” at the team’s practice gym Thursday, Sept. 7, 2023, in Deerfield.Evans, who is averaging 8.7 points off the bench, said she “fell in love” with the Luka 1 while playing overseas because it’s  a comfortable low-top. And now she’s excited to get a pair of the second version of the shoe with details that carry special meaning for her.The shoe is in shades of pink, Evans’ signature color, and blue. The laces are made to look like DNA strands to represent her family. Evans’ dad, Damon, has said he would switch shifts with his co-workers at a Gary steel mill to see Evans play. The shoe also has the number 23 to signify this year, Michael Jordan and pairs of chromosomes.On the insole is a cougar head, an homage to the nickname of Gary West Side, where Evans played in high school. She sits in the top five in scoring in Indiana High School Athletic Association history and was a McDonald’s and Jordan Brand All-American with the Cougars before playing at Louisville.Evans believes West Side was a big part of who she is today.
The insole of Dana Evans’ new shoes features a cougar in honor of her high school, Gary West Side.
The tongues of Dana Evans’ new shoes feature Evans’ logo on the right and Luka Doncic’s on the left.“Coming from a school in Gary where a lot of people said I wouldn’t make it, a lot of people would talk down on it and say I wouldn’t be able to do it,” she explained. “But I love that I went through so many challenges and obstacles throughout my high school journey because I feel it made me so much stronger. It made me have to fight so much harder to get to where I am, and that will always stick with me.”The sneaker also features pink pony hair on the upper to reflect her style of keeping her hair laid — an idea that she can be a baller while also looking good.The tongue has both Doncic and Evans logos, with a Jordan logo on the pull tag. In the shoe’s webbing are lightning to represent her speed, a bull’s-eye for her sharpshooting ability and a heart for her family.Though the sneaker won’t be for sale to the public, Evans hopes that one day a shoe with her name will be.“I definitely would love that,” she said. “I think that’s important for the women’s game as well. I think it would be dope for us to be able to sell our own shoes. I think it will do really well if they give it a chance.” While playing basketball in elementary school, she found herself attracted to “funky colors” that didn’t match her uniform. “I like to stand out on the court. I’ve always been like that,” she told the Tribune. “My favorite pair that started me on the path of being different was probably customizing my Nike Hyperdunks in all pink.” Evans’ love of sneakers will reach a new height in the Sky’s final regular-season home game Friday against the Minnesota Lynx at Wintrust Arena. She will debut her Jordan Luka 2 player edition (PE) shoe, “The Intro,” a special colorway made for Evans of Dallas Mavericks star Luka Doncic’s second signature shoe. To celebrate the occasion, the first 400 fans will receive a sky blue T-shirt with Evans’ DE11 logo. For Evans, the  shoe is a dream come true. “It means a lot because I like to express myself on the court, whether that’s just having my nails, lashes or hair done, and now I’m able to do it through a shoe,” she said. “I’ve always loved shoes. Being able to express myself within a shoe is pretty dope.” Evans, whose sneaker fashion is documented on the Instagram account DanaEvansKicks, signed with Jordan Brand last year and was the first Chicago athlete — male or female — to sign with the NBA legend’s sneaker imprint. “Dana overall embodies exactly what we like to see in our athletes,” Jasmine Jordan, a field representative in the Jordan Brand sports marketing division and the daughter of Michael Jordan, told the Tribune. “When you look at Dana, you don’t think that she’s about to be taking you to the hole and cutting you and pulling back and hitting her jumpers. She’s so skilled and so agile for being so small, and it’s something that stuck out.” One of more than 10 WNBA athletes signed to the brand, Evans is part of a movement to push women to the forefront of sneaker culture. She believes it’s important for female athletes to be visible within the space. “To put ourselves out in that aspect is bringing more viewers, and having more eyes on us is important,” she said. “We’ve talked a lot about that in the WNBA. Just having us being seen means people can relate to us and understand us more through different things.” New York Liberty star Sabrina Ionescu’s signature shoe, the Nike Sabrina 1, was released earlier this month. Washington Mystics forward Elena Delle Donne is the only other current female athlete to have a signature sneaker with the brand. It’s a move Gregory Jones II of G2 Hoops, Evans’ marketing agent, says will have an impact on the league for years to come. “Sabrina’s shoe is probably going to outpace some of the guys that had their first signature shoe,” Jones said. “It shows that there is a lane in the market for women to have signature shoes and PEs. It gives us the opportunity to say that women in the WNBA can sell sneakers, and what that turns into is being able to pay them more as far as their revenue share in that space.” In addition to Evans, Sky players Kahleah Copper, Ruthy Hebard and Elizabeth Williams (Adidas), Isabelle Harrison (Jordan), Marina Mabrey (Under Armour) and Courtney Williams (Moolah Kicks) have sneaker deals. Evans, who is averaging 8.7 points off the bench, said she “fell in love” with the Luka 1 while playing overseas because it’s  a comfortable low-top. And now she’s excited to get a pair of the second version of the shoe with details that carry special meaning for her. The shoe is in shades of pink, Evans’ signature color, and blue. The laces are made to look like DNA strands to represent her family. Evans’ dad, Damon, has said he would switch shifts with his co-workers at a Gary steel mill to see Evans play. The shoe also has the number 23 to signify this year, Michael Jordan and pairs of chromosomes. On the insole is a cougar head, an homage to the nickname of Gary West Side, where Evans played in high school. She sits in the top five in scoring in Indiana High School Athletic Association history and was a McDonald’s and Jordan Brand All-American with the Cougars before playing at Louisville. Evans believes West Side was a big part of who she is today. “Coming from a school in Gary where a lot of people said I wouldn’t make it, a lot of people would talk down on it and say I wouldn’t be able to do it,” she explained. “But I love that I went through so many challenges and obstacles throughout my high school journey because I feel it made me so much stronger. It made me have to fight so much harder to get to where I am, and that will always stick with me.” The sneaker also features pink pony hair on the upper to reflect her style of keeping her hair laid — an idea that she can be a baller while also looking good. The tongue has both Doncic and Evans logos, with a Jordan logo on the pull tag. In the shoe’s webbing are lightning to represent her speed, a bull’s-eye for her sharpshooting ability and a heart for her family. Though the sneaker won’t be for sale to the public, Evans hopes that one day a shoe with her name will be. “I definitely would love that,” she said. “I think that’s important for the women’s game as well. I think it would be dope for us to be able to sell our own shoes. I think it will do really well if they give it a chance.” Copyright © 2024 Chicago Tribune",2023-09-08T10:00:00Z
16,Chelsea Gray,WNBA Champion Chelsea Gray Is Having Her Moment,https://www.essence.com/entertainment/sports/wnba-champion-chelsea-gray-las-vegas/,"Three-time WNBA champion and five-time All-Star Chelsea Gray of the Las Vegas Aces is having her moment. And rightfully so. Not only is she fresh off of two back-to-back WNBA Championships, the Adidas athlete recently joined the ACC Network (ACCN) as a college basketball analyst. So of course she took the time to enjoy the fruits of her labor, in her city (Las Vegas, that is), during one of the biggest sporting events in the world — the Super Bowl. And she couldn’t be prouder to represent. “When I first signed here, the factor about coming here is it’s a big small town,” she tells ESSENCE at an Adidas gifting suite at the Conrad Hotel in Las Vegas. “Everybody is coming here now. Obviously it had entertainment and gambling, but you’re seeing the intersection of the workforce with tech, and then you have music, and then you have sport, and all of that is kind of combined. And so it’s been pretty cool to be a part of that and be a part of that growth.” Gray also describes the joy of being a part of winning culture that makes her time in Vegas magical. “We brought the first professional championship here in Las Vegas,” she beams. “And being a part of history, you are able to write your name that you are a part of making history, and I think that’s pretty cool.” A talent like Gray doesn’t just happen overnight, but with a lot of resilience, hard work and love of the game. “I had a lot of brothers that really were into sports — basketball, football, baseball,” she recalls of how her love of sport developed at a young age. “So I was just surrounded by sports all the time… I just really gravitated to the competition of it, being able to be outside.” In addition to her WNBA accolades, Gray was an All-American in college at Duke, guiding the Blue Devils to two ACC Tournament Championships, three ACC regular season titles and three trips to the NCAA Elite Eight during her four years (2010-14). Holding a hometown connection with fellow point guard Damian Lillard, Adidas even released Gray’s own colorway of the adidas Dame 8 last year. The connection to Adidas is what sparked her interest in her next act. “I do want to somehow get into music somehow,” she shares. “What that looks like, I don’t really know. And I’m starting to get back into fashion more.”  ESSENCE.com is part of ESSENCE Communications, Inc. Essence may receive compensation for some links to products and services on this website.

17,Becky Hammon,Don’t forget the Las Vegas Aces set the standard as WNBA popularity explodes,https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/5488245/2024/05/13/las-vegas-aces-championship-standard-wnba/,"WNBA Game 4 of last season’s WNBA Finals was a fitting culmination of the Las Vegas Aces’ title run, a closeout game that demanded contributions from the totality of the roster. It was also a reminder of how fleeting greatness can be. The Aces, down two starters — with no expectation for their return in a potential do-or-die Game 5 — had just enough to eke out a one-possession win. The jubilation of the result overshadowed how close Las Vegas was to experiencing a different outcome. Advertisement As the Aces embark upon the 2024 season in pursuit of a three-peat, it’s important to appreciate their excellence in this moment. They have a target on their back from 11 other franchises, but that’s because Las Vegas is one of the best teams this league has ever seen. Although it seems like the Aces have a long runway of titles in front of them, with three All-WNBA players under age 30, their most recent coronation is a reminder of how precarious success can be. At this time a year ago, Las Vegas had a starting group of five potential future Hall of Famers. That lineup didn’t even last half the season, and now Candace Parker is retired. Chelsea Gray and Kiah Stokes couldn’t suit up at the end of the finals, with Gray’s foot injury lingering to the start of the 2024 campaign. Most of the Aces have signed below-market contracts to remain in Las Vegas and remain together, but roster-building might be out of their control with the upcoming expansion draft. The core that exists today could have a chance to compete only in this particular season. GAME FRAMES 📸#ALLINLV pic.twitter.com/loP3ZGS7NB — Las Vegas Aces (@LVAces) May 12, 2024  That’s why the Aces aren’t shying away from the task in front of them. They talk about creating habits and not looking too far ahead, but they’ve also made their ultimate goal very clear from the get-go: to win and join the Houston Comets as the only franchises in league history with three consecutive championships. “When you come into a season with the Aces uniform on, the standard is going for a championship,” Gray said. Las Vegas has every reason to believe that goal is attainable. It has the best player in the world, A’ja Wilson, an unstoppable force on both ends of the floor who could become the fourth three-time MVP in league history. Wilson’s impact is so undeniable that even Team USA looked mortal at the 2024 Olympic qualifying tournament without her in the middle. GO DEEPER A'ja Wilson named Nike signature athlete Wilson relishes that the rest of the league is getting better, using it to motivate her to keep working on her craft; similarly, her thirst for continuous improvement inspires teammates and rivals alike. There’s nothing like watching her simultaneously blow by and power through defenders while taking away their airspace on the other end. She’s a unique talent whose motor is never-ending. Advertisement The Aces also have one of the most dynamic point guards in league history, one whose highlight reel defies logic and gravity, and delights fans across sports. Gray brought her championship pedigree to Las Vegas and has continued to rack up hardware. Her motto this season is “trying to chase history and be legendary.” There’s Jackie Young and Kelsey Plum, the bowling ball and the blur on the perimeter, testing opposing defenses in diametric ways. Stokes controls the glass, Alysha Clark defends everyone, and Sydney Colson is a pest at the point of attack. Whatever style of play you seek as a basketball fan, the Aces provide some of it. Every skill is represented and put on display at the highest possible level under the direction of Hall of Fame coach Becky Hammon, who has done nothing but win since stepping into this role. Las Vegas is basketball paradise. The Aces play together and for each other, and that commitment to the team concept shines through, no matter what adverse situations they face. “This year is going to be harder than last year, and last year was hella hard,” Hammon said. “We come in with the pressure and we’ll operate fine under that pressure, but we know what the deal is.” Only two teams in WNBA history have even had a chance to three-peat in 27 seasons, and not since the inaugural champion Comets won four in a row has a team accomplished that feat. No team in the NBA has even gone back-to-back-to-back since 2002. In North American professional sports, the three-peat has nearly gone extinct during this century, which puts Las Vegas in rarefied air. BIG A not the little one 😤@_ajawilson22 // #ALLINLV pic.twitter.com/sOpe6FC5QB — Las Vegas Aces (@LVAces) May 11, 2024  Whether they’re the hero or the villain, the Aces’ story arc demands attention. They’re chasing history at an individual and team level and forcing the rest of the league to match their standard. Super-teams are popping up across the country in hopes of competing with what Las Vegas has built. “It’s tons of fun just to stay in the moment and understand what we’re building here,” Wilson said. “The legacy that we are forming here is something that’s so cool to be a part of.” Advertisement So take a moment to appreciate what the Aces have created when the season tips off Tuesday. Enjoy the majesty of Wilson, the flair of Gray, the poise of Young, the feistiness of Plum and how they’ve brought out the best in themselves and their opponents. As the WNBA experiences an explosion of popularity, remember they are the standard-bearers, the bar that has been set for the incoming rookies and everyone else.

Copyright: xWendellxCruzx 19074007 The back-to-back WNBA champions, the Las Vegas Aces, have a brand new look. No, we are not talking about their upgraded jerseys. Although, that too is a reason to celebrate! But having to wait till the second round, the current most successful franchise still got their hands full by grabbing some exceptional college basketball talent. Consequently, this delighted their head coach, Becky Hammon, and she couldn’t wait to interact with each one of them. Moreover, a personal touch was recently extended by the Aces’ boss to her team’s latest recruits. The 2022 WNBA Coach of the Year called up each of the draft players and expressed how pumped she felt about having them. Welcoming Dyaisha, she recalled how ecstatic she was, eager to see her “drop some buckets.” In addition to this, she addressed Martin too, complementing her basketball IQ. Later, Virginia Tech’s standout athlete, Elizabeth Kitley, also got her attention. Wishing her a successful career, Becky also assured comfortable travel arrangements for all Las Vegas Aces players.     A post shared by Las Vegas Aces (@lvaces) ADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad  Seemingly, the Aces have drafted four new ballers to their already formidable roster. In the second round, they went fourth and included former Syracuse guard Dyaisha Fair. Soon after, she was followed by Kate Martin (18th overall), who was the second choice for a guard after Fair. Then, they went on to meet their demands for two centers when they brought Elizabeth Kitley and Angel Jackson to the Aces locker room. As for now, all four might feature in Las Vegas’ opening fixture on May 15, 2024, appearing against Phoenix in their latest Nike ‘Rebel Edition’ jerseys. ADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad Significantly, the roster is not the only new thing that the Aces will be flaunting this season. As it turns out, they will take the court this season donning the new Nike Rebel Edition uniform. Moreover, the Red in their jerseys signifies their consecutive championship success. An official news release states, “Red represents energy, strength, passion and action—all core parts of the Aces winning identity.” The ‘ACES’ text is printed vertically next to the player jersey in this attire. As per reports, these jerseys will soon be on sale, available online starting April 23.     A post shared by Las Vegas Aces (@lvaces)  ADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad It will be an exciting affair to witness the Las Vegas Aces roster this season, with so many fresh talents. They have immense potential to be match-winners, and it will be interesting to see how Hammon utilizes them.

20,Chloe Jackson,Chlöe Pierre on redefining self-care and what it means for black women,https://www.breakingnews.ie/lifestyle/chloe-pierre-on-redefining-self-care-and-what-it-means-for-black-women-1419753.html,"
By Abi Jackson, PA
 Self-care may be a term we use every day, but what does it really mean? It’s a question Chlöe Pierre – founder of ‘disruptive wellness platform brand’ thy.self and author of new book Take Care: The Black Women’s Guide To Wellness – started asking around five years ago. “Overworking and under a lot of pressure”, challenges in her personal life and “partying a lot” didn’t help – and a series of “pivotal moments” (like developing terrifying sleep paralysis) made clear it was time to start taking better care of herself. Except Pierre – newly 30 at the time and working in PR and digital marketing – realised she didn’t know how. “It was a journey of learning and rediscovering what that is, because I wasn’t taught how to take care of myself in that sense,” she explains over Zoom. “It was always such an outward, external-facing option – make sure you do your hair, and you look good.”  
Having a wellbeing wake-up call is something many will relate to. For Pierre though, what started as personal journey quickly became something much bigger – when she started accessing the wellbeing spaces on offer and “very soon realised that I was often the only black, plus-sized person in the room”. Not only was the wellness world very white, it had also seemingly packaged self-care into something very exclusive and expensive, catering for an overwhelmingly slim, cis, middle-class clientele. This was the catalyst for founding thy.self (thyself.space) in 2018, with the aim of ‘diversifying the wellness industry’ and making self-care more inclusive, relatable and more welcoming to black women. Alongside running events, workshops and content creation, thy.self works with brands looking to deliver on their own diversity goals (they’ve collaborated with the likes of Nike, ASOS and Samsung). And it’s evolved and grown over time, Pierre notes. “When I started off creating thy.self, I really wanted to push for change, and change people’s perceptions. But over the years – you know, we’ve been through Covid, we’ve been through lockdown, I’ve become a mother, I’ve experienced things – it made me realise I can’t change anyone’s thoughts,” she reflects. “I was on this journey to break down the wellness industry, and I still want to do that, but I know it starts with me. So, I portray the life I want to lead and curate the environments I want to be in – and not only have I created a safe space for myself, I’ve created a safe space for likeminded people who want to be there.”   At the heart of this is a thriving community. “Community is everything,” says Pierre. “I really believe in the work we do as individuals, but also building out into a wider community. I wouldn’t do any of this if it wasn’t for community – that is my biggest driver. “There’s a bigger purpose in community. No movement was ever created by one person. I never really want the credit for things, I just want to see change, because that means other people will be happy, safe, and feel seen. That’s what joy is to me.” A lot of it’s about sharing ideas and options for self-care, without having to “commodify everything”. As well as celebrating the cultural heritage and origins of many wellness practices – and as Pierre puts it, “giving credit where credit is due”. These are all themes she explores in the book, alongside her own journey. Take Care also sees Pierre consult with various experts and dive into some key areas – including imposter syndrome, grief and loss, authenticity, motherhood and black beauty – sharing stories and prompts along the way. Whilst it is essentially a guide, Pierre is not here to tell anyone how to ‘do’ self-care. It’s more about empowering black women on their own journeys, “being aware” of their own needs and “offering options” designed to welcome and celebrate them. For Pierre, reaching this point herself when all this started five years ago, meant spending time alone. “I do think discovering your own self-care essentially comes through a lot of solitude, so you discover what you like, what works for you, and what you need,” she says. “And those things aren’t even linked at times, what you need and want are completely different things. “That’s what I’ve learned about wellbeing – that it’s actually sometimes quite uncomfortable, just like most truths are quite uncomfortable to take on. I always relate self-care and wellness to becoming your own best friend, but it’s not an overnight job.” Plus, things change. “To me, it’s still an ongoing journey to be honest” – and this includes the last two years writing the book, she says. “I feel like a completely different person to when I got the book offer, my world and self-care at that time was completely different. And now, being a mum – I became a mum a year after accepting the offer – it’s different. I’m still learning.”  
So, what does self-care look like for Pierre right now? She’s a “massive fan of massage – it really brings you back to yourself”, while mindful breathing and practising gratitude are also key (“I could moan ‘til the cows come home, but there’s so much to be thankful for – that’s what draws me out of depression, if I’m honest”). And one thing really lighting her up? “Being in nature… it’s free, it’s beautiful, it can fulfil you in ways you never expected. You don’t know what you’re going to get – you can take the same route every time, but one left turn or right turn and you’re completely on a different path. “And it brings you back to the simplicity of the human race, and why we’re here – outside of the buildings, the work, the relationships – what our purpose is. It’s just so grounding. “For me, that is wonderful.”   Take Care by Chlöe Pierre is published by Headline. Available now.  Message submitting... Thank you for waiting.

21,Glory Johnson,Olympic glory and Katarina Johnson-Thompson's retirement decision after boyfriend's announcement,https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/sport/other-sport/olympic-glory-katarina-johnson-thompsons-29713159,"Katarina Johnson-Thompson finally ended her Olympic hoodoo by winning heptathlon silver in Paris - with boyfriend Andrew Pozzi in the Stade de France to cheer her on Never miss breaking news by signing up to our free email updates We have more newsletters Never miss breaking news by signing up to our free email updates We have more newsletters Katarina Johnson-Thompson laid it all on the line to secure heptathlon silver at the Stade de France for her first Olympic medal. The Liverpudlian sat 121 points behind Belgian champion Nafissatou Thiam entering the final event, the 800 metres. She faced a nearly impossible task, needing to beat Thiam by more than eight seconds to surpass her main rival. Johnson-Thompson clocked a personal best 2:04.90, but it was not quite enough as she finished 36 points behind Thiam, who has now twice successfully defended her Olympic title. Belgium’s Noor Vidts completed the podium. Johnson-Thompson finished nearly six seconds ahead of the Olympic champion, and second-fastest overall behind the United States’ Anna Hall. Nine of the top 11 finishers clocked personal bests, while Hall equalled her season’s best 2:04.39. A maiden medal has been a long time coming for Johnson-Thompson, who finished 13th on Olympic debut at London 2012, then sixth at the Rio 2016 Games. The 31-year-old was then forced to pull out of the Tokyo 2020 Olympics after sustaining a calf injury in the 200 metres. Here's a glimpse into her life away from the Olympics, as reported by Wales Online... Johnson-Thompson has been in a relationship with fellow Olympian and British hurdler Andrew Pozzi since 2018. The couple maintain a long-distance relationship, with Pozzi based in Cardiff while Johnson-Thompson has resided in Loughborough and Montpellier since they began their romance. Three-time Olympian Pozzi was supporting Johnson-Thompson from the sidelines in Paris, after having to hang up his spikes just days before this year's Games due to a ""serious ankle fracture"" sustained during training. In an emotional social media announcement, he shared: ""After missing the 2023 season with serious injury, I have battled exceptionally hard to return to the world stage and earnt my place at what would have been my fourth Olympic Games. Unfortunately, as I continued to build and improve upon my 13.23s clocking in Montgeron, my body gave way in training to another serious ankle fracture."" Pozzi went on to say: ""I have decided that now is the right time for me to retire from professional athletics,"" expressing both profound sadness and acceptance of his decision, knowing he had given his all to the sport with ""This is a profoundly sad moment, but also one that I can embrace fully with the knowledge that I have approached every minute of my time in this sport with uncompromising focus, resolute determination and the highest of standards."" Despite his retirement, Pozzi has been a vocal supporter of Johnson-Thompson's achievements, celebrating her world heptathlon gold last year on social media by stating: ""The best all round athlete on the planet. Again."" As the Paris Games approached, there was chatter about whether it might be Katarina Johnson-Thompson's final appearance, especially if she secured a spot on the podium in what could be the pinnacle of her career. However, Johnson-Thompson has dismissed any notion of retirement from heptathlon. In an interview with Athletics Weekly, she expressed her commitment to the sport: ""The phrase, 'one last push' doesn't come to mind. I feel like I am growing into myself and the longer that I've been doing the sport, the more I know about myself and I know how to be ready for it."" She continued, ""I understand what my body needs, what my mind needs, and how to get a good performance. I feel like I am getting stronger in the sense of I know how to do it better than I did 10 years ago. It saddens me at the thought of having all this knowledge and then stopping. As long as I am competitive, I will continue the sport."" Speaking on GB News' On The Money, Johnson-Thompson revealed her plans to retire at 35, which could see her competing in the subsequent Olympics in Los Angeles in 2028. Discussing the financial challenges faced by athletes, she explained, ""I think the illusion of track and field is many people, unless they are ranked in the top 10 in the world, struggle to earn a decent wage,"" adding, ""For me the struggle was that my career isn't going to last a lifetime."" ""I'm going to probably retire when I'm 35 and many banks don't really understand that sort of payment setup. But with the rise in living costs, many people are struggling to get on the property ladder for different reasons."" Johnson-Thompson reportedly boasts an estimated net worth of around $4.5million. Back in 2022, she was named as the fourth richest British sportswoman under 30 years old according to the Heat Rich list. Much of her net worth has been boosted by her partnership with Nike, while she has also endorsed other huge brands including Estee Lauder, EA, Müller and British Gas. Despite her sizeable net worth, Johnson-Thompson admitted she had struggled to buy her first home. Appearing on GB News’ On The Money, she said: “I had trouble buying my first home a couple of years ago. I think the illusion of track and field is, it was so nice to say all those facts and stuff, but many people, unless they are ranked in the top 10 in the world, struggle to earn a decent wage. “For me the struggle was that my career isn't going to last a lifetime and I’m going to probably retire when I’m 35 and many banks don’t really understand that sort of payment setup. But with the rise in living costs, many people are struggling to get on the property ladder for different reasons."" Katarina Johnson-Thompson has shared the poignant motivation behind her winning drive in the aftermath of personal tragedy - the loss of her father Ricardo in 2017 when he was just 59. Ricardo, a production assistant at ZNS-TV, died in his native Bahamas, having lived apart from Katarina since she was one year old. Despite the geographical distance after Katarina's return to Liverpool with her family after a year, their bond remained strong. In an emotional revelation to the Daily Mail months after his passing, the heptathlete confessed the ""difficult"" period had a galvanising effect on her performance: ""What happened with my dad is why I have been so switched on in competitions,"" she said, fuelled by her father never seeing her win, driving her to succeed before her mother, who is always ringside supporting her. Reflecting further in a candid interview with the Guardian, she said, ""I am proud of myself because there have been some hard and difficult times. But dad definitely spurred me on this year. I wanted to start winning things. I wanted my family to see me doing well. And I think I have done that for sure."" ",2024-08-09T19:59:51Z
22,Lisa Leslie,"Despite Caitlin Clark Move, Nike’s Gender Bias Over Signature Sneaker Exposed by Ex-Agent (Exclusive)",https://www.essentiallysports.com/wnba-basketball-news-despite-caitlin-clark-move-nikes-gender-bias-over-signature-sneaker-exposed-by-ex-agent-exclusive-lisa-leslie-leonard-armato/,"More Sports ES Fancast May 24, 2024 | 10:02 AM CDT via Imago Caitlin Clark, Leonard Armato (Credits: Imago) via Imago Caitlin Clark, Leonard Armato (Credits: Imago) The basketball world turned their heads when it was reported the Indiana Fever rookie Caitlin Clark would be signing a $28 million deal for 8 years. The agreement also landed Clark a signature shoe which is expected to be out on the market soon. However, women’s sports are taking a step towards advancement and with it, equal recognition. But, things weren’t as breezy for them as they look now. Now that the women’s sports after the emergence of Clark hit a record ticket revenue of around $2 million during the recent Indiana Fever game against the New York Liberty, it is time to look at some of the biases that the sport has endured over these years. Entrepreneur and sports agent Leonard Armato recently got in an exclusive chat with EssentiallySports and answered some looming questions from Vishal Kolar. Armato’s experience as an agent got us some stories that were previously privy to a few people. His account of trying to get a signature deal with Nike on behalf of the WNBA veteran Lisa Leslie rang a few bells of undervaluing women’s sports previously. ADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad Vishal Kolar: “Another thing you’ve been very vocal about right is… is the gender pay gap… pay gap in sports. Um, and your volleyball league did a lot of progress in wiping that out. Um, and now Caitlin Clark’s Nike Deal started a completely different conversation with the likes of A’ja Wilson, you know essentially being ignored. Um, as someone who’s seen these decisions up close like what do you think drives these scenarios and more importantly like how… how do they respond to these claims of bias?” Leonard Armato: “Well, it’s really interesting. Um, I remember representing Lisa Lesley and we went to Nike way back when and said ‘hey we want a shoe deal. We want a signature shoe’ and they laughed at me and said there’s no way you know… Nobody buys shoes because women wear them. You know, when women play basketball they look at Michael Jordan and see what he’s wearing and that’s what they want to wear so you know we’ll pay you little money but that’s it they don’t you know you,you don’t drive any sales for us.”  ADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad Leslie got her Nike Total Air 9 in 1998 which was a major success during that time and also was the first major shoe by a women’s basketball player. Meanwhile, the craze for Jordans is such that Nike introduced a special batch of Air Jordans 4s for WNBA players in 2023. The shoes were minty green in color and were introduced to the fans by Nike’s senior designer Kelsey Amy. Therefore, there is no denying that the sporting company has pushed men’s sneakers and gained a lot from it. Meanwhile, with Clark’s emergence, the disparity has equaled to a lot extent. As per The Guardian, Clark received numerous offers of shoe deals including one from Under Armour and another from Adidas for $16 million and $6 million respectively for four years. But the NCAA queen chose Nike over others. ADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad She will soon release her shoes and if fans are to be believed Clark’s signature shoes could break records that were made by Jordan’s in 1985. Finally, it looks like men’s basketball has got a worthy opponent in a woman player. This story from Armato only demonstrates how far we have come; perhaps with Clark’s emergence in the WNBA, women’s sports might overtake their male counterparts.

25,Candace Parker,Mamas At Work: Candace Parker Takes Us Inside Hartt's Safari-Themed Nursery,https://www.essence.com/lifestyle/mamas-at-work-candace-parker/,"On June 10, Candace Parker surprised fans by announcing that she and her wife, Anya Petrakova, welcomed their second child together a month prior on May 21. Named Hartt Summitt Petrakov Parker, the littlest member of their brood makes them a family of five now.  It’s been beautiful chaos, having a teenager in 15-year-old Lailaa, a 2-year-old in Airr, and now, an infant all under one roof, but Parker, who recently retired from the WNBA, is loving every minute with her favorite teammates — her family. She’s also had the chance to partner up with another special team in Crate & Kids. The kids’ furniture sector of Crate & Barrel partnered with Parker ahead of Hartt’s arrival to create the ultimate safari-themed nursery. The end result is a warm, inviting space coated in rich browns, and soft greens, and featuring some truly cozy furniture, including a luxurious glider that makes Hartt’s room the place to be at casa Petrakov Parker.  We talked to the new president of Adidas Women’s Basketball, three-time WNBA champion, and seven-time All-Star about reimagining her home for her newest addition, being a mom of three children at wildly different stages of their young lives, and why her favorite form of self-care still revolves around her littles.   ESSENCE: For baby Hartt’s nursery, what was the inspiration? I see a lot of lion imagery and browns! Candace Parker: We envisioned a bright, safari-themed colorful room with lots of style and cute details. The most difficult part of designing and decorating a new space is taking the ideas in your head and making them a reality, but the Crate & Kids Design Desk team made this such an easy process. We would have never thought to make the walls a warm terracotta color, but the Crate & Kids team included it in the design renderings, and we are so happy with the final look – it pairs so nicely with the safari-themed pieces like the jungle-inspired crib quilt. You briefly began to discuss this, but how did Crate & Kids come in and bring your ideas for the space to life? The Crate & Kids team was incredible to work with. We loved collaborating with the designers to bring our vision to life. There were a lot of components that went into this nursery, and we loved building out our vision from scratch with the Crate & Kids registry. Anya was in awe when she saw the finished room and kept saying that it looks so stylish and cozy! The full nursery is available to shop on Crate & Kids now! What is your favorite thing in the room? That bed looks mighty cozy. I also love the green furniture! I also love the green furniture—it’s such an extraordinary and elegant color. The sage dresser and crib are two of my favorite pieces in the room. A good rocking chair was also a must-have for the nursery, and I am in love with the glider. It pairs so nicely with the sage green furniture, terracotta walls, and wood accents throughout the room. How are you adjusting to being a mother of three, with a teenager and two kiddos under two? Just like in basketball, we’re adjusting our defense from man to man to zone. It’s been especially exciting having two new courts to play on, between the nursery and new room, but we are loving it and are so excited to continue to play our starting lineup! You are on serious diaper duty. When you have the chance, how do you practice self-care? It’s definitely been difficult finding time, but I honestly think that the best self-care is spending time with family. Whether it’s watching Lai’s volleyball games or chasing Goose around the house, it’s my favorite way to spend my downtime. You can shop items from Parker’s full nursery for Hartt over at Crate & Kids.  ESSENCE.com is part of ESSENCE Communications, Inc.

26,Candace Parker,Candace Parker Shares Her Vision For Her Next Chapter - Essence,https://www.essence.com/fashion/candace-parker-adidas-wnba-all-star-weekend-feature/,"Candace Parker, the newly appointed president of Adidas Women’s Basketball, candidly opened up about her hopes for her latest era. Since announcing her retirement from basketball, a sport she’s been enthralled by for decades, she has shifted her focus to elevating a brand that feels intrinsically part of her. In Phoenix, where she attended All-Star Weekend for the first time as a non-player, her discernment rang loudly over a call she took while prepping for press appearances and events. She details that it’s important to understand what she and Adidas aim to accomplish. “We’re trying to sell shoes and have Adidas on as many people’s feet as we can,” she says. “But in the process, we’re trying to grow the game of basketball and grow women’s basketball especially.” Parker notes that right now is an ideal time for this, given the eyes that are fixated on the WNBA and women’s sports. The three-time WNBA champion, former Las Vegas Aces player, and seven-time All-Star says she thinks that Adidas can succeed by making an impact from a grassroots standpoint. She declares doing so will mean providing more opportunities for athletes who have deserved it for a long time. Currently, players on the roster include Kahleah Copper, Chelsea Gray, Erica Wheeler, and others. Copper is a standout due to her knack for style on and off the court. Notably, part of the work will be Parker and the brand teaming up to raise the bar and continue to put women at the forefront, says the Naperville, Illinois native.  Parker isn’t taking her new appointment lightly. She expresses that she’s been in three stripes since her sophomore year in high school and through college at the University of Tennessee–she counts that as 16 years professionally. “My longest-standing partnerships [are] Gatorade and Adidas,” she said. She also mentions she will never forget what it was like putting on her first pair of Tracy McGrady Pro Model sneakers years ago. Parker’s first official Adidas sneaker under the “Ace” line was launched in 2010. First includes the Ace Commander and the Ace Versatility, which is a significant part of the canon associated with women basketball players. It began with Sheryl Swoopes, who was the first woman to have her own athletic sneaker. According to Andscape, in 2021, Adidas released three colorways of the exhibit A sneaker, each inspired by Parker.   Since the role will take on a leadership capacity, Parker explains that she will identify hoopers who have passion and want to do more than lace up their sneakers and cash a check. “I’ve always tried to represent the brand in a positive way, and so now, it’s just a different role in doing that. I’m so grateful,” she said.  Since she will always be a player first, this is the unique prowess she brings to Adidas. Parker hopes she will bring this mentality or the player’s perspective to the boardroom. “I feel like the culture that we want to build at Adidas [centers] empowerment,” she said. “When you feel ownership for something, and you feel empowered by something that you’re a part of, you’re going to work harder for it.” She adds that it’s not by chance that anyone is given equity and power. One should go above and beyond when given these opportunities, says Parker.  “We want to be that brand that is for the athletes, represents the athletes, [and] empowers the athletes,” Candace shares. She expresses that she feels she is building this type of internal culture while being in search of athletes who will align with these ideals. She says she’s a testament to what can happen when an athletic company’s culture is largely focused on athletes.  “I have been in different positions with Adidas, and through it all, they’ve stuck with me. I’ve been overseas for six months out of the year. I’ve been pregnant, I’ve been injured.” With conviction, she expands on this notion of togetherness: Parker says that she and Adidas both had a passion for growing together. “That’s what a partnership is, and that’s what I want to do in this roster, continue to make sure we’re inspiring the next [generation].”  Parker says athletes are dismantling the “shut up and dribble” remark from years ago. Candace says this notion carries over to more than just politics too. In her words, “I think it’s also your career [ends], and the lights dim as soon as you’re done playing you’re not relevant,” she said. Yet, she says athletes are changing that narrative.  She firmly states that as a graduate and degree holder from the University of Tennessee, she feels that her experiences overseas and in the U.S. playing basketball have molded her into a stakeholder. And she believes that there are a number of athletes who can be valuable to organizations and corporations in addition to decision-making entities.  Her 15-year-old daughter Lailaa is a perfect example of what is on the horizon for the future generation. “She believes she can do anything she puts her mind to,” she said. “I think that’s what we’re ushering in, is the next generation that really, truly believes that. And so, we need people that are in positions and making decisions that will put them in the positions to be able to have [an] impact.” At a private Adidas event during WNBA All-Star Weekend at Toca Madera in Scottsdale honoring Parker, a few energies were permeating, but one stood out, gratitude. To put it plainly, Parker received her flowers from her peers, luminaries, and emerging stars of the WNBA. Faces in the room included Copper, Sue Bird, Parker’s wife, Anna Petrakova, Lailaa, and countless others who showcased the human side of the legend.  At one point in the evening, Nneka Ogwumike declared Parker has a “penchant for disruption,” an intentional monicker that sums up the core of who the basketball player is and will continue to be.  “My first love was basketball. It’s scary when it ends. It doesn’t matter if you have things lined up. So, I just hope that other athletes that are ending their career know that you are valuable, your experience is extremely valuable, and we hope to prove that at Adidas,” Parker adds before we end our conversation.

A career lived to its potential and a range of accolades earned through hard work. No one would argue that the 3x WNBA champion has earned every ounce of the respect she got in her professional basketball career. However, was ending her career in haste the best of the ideas? Seems like she may be getting some jitters for her actions. So much so that she is finding ways to keep her game mode on and the competitive juices flowing even at home. Game night with dominoes and board games was always a thing in the Parker household. But it was always different from what competing on the floor meant. Battling for a purpose and finding a way to lead the team always hit differently. But going against your own family and a pregnant wife can be quite costly. Talking about playing on the in-house hoop with her wife Anna Petrakova with the People Magazine, the 7x All-Star star said, “I almost feel bad for my wife because last week we were playing horse, and I’m talking mess to a pregnant lady that’s almost about to deliver. And I’m like, ‘Well, you knew what you were doing when you stepped out here.’ It’s more so getting the competitive juices out.” ADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad Candace Parker Talks Her ‘Bittersweet' Retirement and Says She’ll Love the Game ‘Forever’ (Exclusive) https://t.co/uWidzC7xmC — People (@people) May 13, 2024 Expand Tweet  In her long Instagram post where she announced that she was stepping away, Parker assured her fans that she would return, but not as a player. So, with 16 seasons under her belt on the biggest stage of professional basketball, how has Candace Parker become the echoing name that she is? ADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad An idol to many, the Missouri-born hooper has visited many cities that she would now call home. Being drafted as the first overall pick in 2008, she spent a decade and a couple more years with her first team, the LA Sparks. She brought the Brian Agler-led team its last championship in 2016. Moving to the Chicago Sky, she again brought a WNBA title home. And then again with the Aces last year. Parker became the only WNBA player to ever get a trophy with three franchises. She is also the only athlete in the W to win Rookie of the Year and the Most Valuable Player in the same year, something people believe that Caitlin Clark has a high chance of repeating. ADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad Seems like her latest interview with the magazine, which added her name to its 100 World’s Most Beautiful People back in 2007, is revealing the loss Parker believes her WNBA journey ending is. The legend left the sport because her recurring surgeries did not allow her to be herself on the court if she even played. Not to mention, she skipped almost half of the previous season with the Aces due to her injury. While the fans may never see this beautiful soul in a uniform again, she has promised to own a team and stay in broadcasting. Giving a toast to her long run in the league and her family for supporting the GOAT no matter what.

She has also contributed to the team as they won consecutive WNBA championships in the last two years, securing the Commissioner’s Cup in 2022. Moreover, Kelsey Plum even won her Olympic gold in the 2020 Tokyo event, with 2 golds from the World Cup Championships in 2018 and 2020. via Getty SEATTLE, WASHINGTON – MAY 20: Alysha Clark #7, A’ja Wilson #22, Kelsey Plum #10 and Candace Parker #3 of the Las Vegas Aces react after a basket by Wilson during the second quarter against the Seattle Storm at Climate Pledge Arena on May 20, 2023 in Seattle, Washington. (Photo by Steph Chambers/Getty Images) While Plum is currently still with the Aces, she has also set foot in other countries for additional income. Here’s what her external sources have looked like over the years. Plum has been a huge name in America due to her ever-present contributions on and off the court. However, the Arkansas graduate assistant is also quite active in participating outside of the country. She has dressed up for Fenerbahçe for two years, from 2017 to 2019. Apparently, her pairing with the Turkey-based club brings another $100,000 season to her bank account. In her last year with the franchise, she also won the Turkish Cup, proving her grip on the game, internationally. Furthermore, she earned the title of Turkish Super League champion twice, marking her efforts in 2018 and 2019. Later, Kelsey even represented Galatasaray in 2022, yet another Turkish club in Istanbul. In the EuroLeague, she contributed 15.8 points, 6.5 rebounds, and 2.8 assists per game for her team. According to sources, this contract was for 6 months and amounted to $120,000 for Plum. However, that was the last time Kelsey Plum played overseas. Certainly, she is now focusing on playing only for the USA and her team, the Aces. As these overseas games run during the off-season, she can enter the field once again. As of now, Plum is trying to make it into the Olympic team, hoping to bring another gold for the country. Whether she will make it into the team or not is yet to be decided, with almost a month left. However, she does have more income sources in the form of her endorsement deals. ADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad The Cali athlete has been signing endorsement deals ever since she entered the professional league as a rookie. On April 29, 2017, the then-San-Antonio-Stars player announced on her X account that she was joining the Nike family. This was a multiyear deal and she swooshed for the company for five years straight; a huge move for a rookie back then. But now, this has become the norm, as recently, Caitlin Clark bagged unarguably the largest deal for women athletes in basketball with a whopping eight-digit deal that included a signature shoe. However, she then publicized that she would be joining hands with one of the rival brands of the sports apparel mogul, Under Armour. In 2022, Kelsey Plum said, “Those transitions (entering the professional league from college) can be a lot easier if you have flashcards on what to do and what not to do. I think you’re going to see a lot of cool things coming out in the future with me, the next generation, and of course Under Armour leading the way in that.” Consequently, the brand has been turning tides with the guard. They have started the DAWG class, which is in its second iteration this year. This helps the rookies and the best of the college students to smoothly transition into the professional league.     A post shared by Kelsey Plum (@kelseyplum10) ADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad  Notably, these two endorsements alone brought at least $1.4 million for the standout hooper. Aside from these contracts, she is also an advocate for better pay for female athletes. Plum’s off-court activities also involve bringing more helping cues to the developing hoopers. It is amazing to see how much Kelsey Plum has evolved over the years and has also boosted her image as a player simultaneously.

30,Allie Quigley,2022 WNBA All-Star Weekend: Allie Quigley makes 3-Point Contest history; Sabrina Ionescu wins Skills Challenge,https://www.cbssports.com/wnba/news/2022-wnba-all-star-weekend-allie-quigley-makes-3-point-contest-history-sabrina-ionescu-wins-skills-challenge/,"If not listed, please contact your TV provider. Chicago is playing host to WNBA All-Star Weekend for the first time ever, and this year marked the return of All-Star Saturday, which featured the Skills Challenge and the 3-Point Contest. The events did not disappoint, as Sabrina Ionescu won the Skills Challenge and Allie Quigley made history with her fourth 3-Point Contest title.  Sabrina Ionescu is putting together a historic season, and on Sunday will play in the All-Star Game for the first time in her career. But first, she was a participant in the Skills Challenge on All-Star Saturday, and cruised to the title along with her teammate, Zoe Brooks, who is committed to NC State.  This year, each WNBA participant was paired with a high school player from the Elite Youth Basketball League (EYBL) participating in the 2022 Nike Nationals, which are also taking place in Chicago. Each team went through an obstacle course that tested various skills including ball-handling, passing and shooting, and were pitted against each other in a three-round, bracket-style format.  Ionescu faced a slight bit of adversity in the first round when Chicago Sky big Azura Stevens knocked the ball away from her after the layup portion of the course. She bounced back, however, and made the 3-pointer first to advance to the semi-finals. She cruised through that round, knocking out Las Vegas Aces guard Kelsey Plum with ease.  Then, it was time for the finals, where she was matched up against Indiana Fever rookie NaLyssa Smith. The No. 2 overall pick made a surprise run through the event, upsetting hometown favorite Courtney Vandersloot of the Sky in the first round and reigning MVP Jonquel Jones of the Connecticut Sun in the semis. Her progress would end there, though, as Ionescu showed why she's one of the best point guards in the league.  Sabrina Ionescu and Zoe Brooks are the 2022 WNBA Skills Challenge champs 🏆#WNBAAllStar pic.twitter.com/ZOE7x8jAR6 ""I had a great partner, which helped,"" Ionescu said. ""I told myself I wasn't gonna get too competitive, but I got really competitive. I'm happy we won."" 
 The 3-Point Contest was back for a fifth straight year and pitted the league's best shooters against each other in a timed competition. As expected, the reigning champion Allie Quigley of the Chicago Sky defended her title and made history in the process. Her 30 points were a record for the contest, and she is now the only player in WNBA or NBA history to win the 3-Point Contest four times.  As always, there were five racks with five balls each spaced out around the arc. Four of the racks contained four regular balls worth one point and one ""money ball"" worth two points. One of the racks was the ""money ball rack"" and contained five ""money balls"" worth two points. In addition, there were two ""DEW ZONE"" locations well beyond the 3-point line. Each one contained one special ""DEW ZONE ball"" worth three points. The first round was quite competitive, as Washington Mystics guard Ariel Atkins went first and set the tone with 24 points. No. 1 overall pick Rhyne Howard of the Atlanta Dream matched that with 24 of her own. Each of them booked a ticket to the final round, along with the reigning champion Allie Quigley of the Chicago Sky, who made every shot on her money ball rack to put up 26 points.  .@alliequigley was perfect on the money rack 💰🎯#WNBAAllStar pic.twitter.com/5ramlCToTP In the final round, Atkins closed strong by hitting every shot on her final rack to put up 21 points. That was not enough, though, as Quigley put on an absolute show to win the trophy. She hit both of the DEW ZONE shots and went 3 of 5 from the ""money ball"" rack to put up 30 points.  LIGHTS. OUT.@alliequigley BECOMES THE FIRST FOUR-TIME 3-PT CONTEST CHAMPION IN WNBA OR NBA HISTORY‼#WNBAAllStar pic.twitter.com/Nfqy73ds0a ""This is for everybody here who was pushing me all summer to do this,"" Quigley said. ""Just so much support from Chicago. The shooters tonight were unbelievable, they set the bar so high. I'm just so happy to be here and bring this to Chicago.""  During her post-event press conference, Quigley announced she is officially retired from the event.  As for calls from Candace Parker and others to rename the event after her, Quigley was honored: ""If they want to do that, I'd be okay with that.""  © 2004-2024 CBS Interactive.

31,Dawn Staley,Dawn Staley enjoys different Olympic view as a fan,https://www.wltx.com/article/news/nation-world/dawn-staley-olympics-fan/101-58bf34b6-ad3e-4985-94e9-f5b1b883f797,"PARIS, France — Dawn Staley is trying something new at the Paris Olympics: She’s a fan. Yes, Staley has been to six previous Olympics — three as a player, two as an assistant and then one as the head coach. And all six of those teams won gold medals in women's basketball. In Paris, she’s seen a slew of gold-medal moments, but as a spectator. “I’m living my best life,” Staley said with a wide smile at an appearance at the Nike Athlete’s House during the Games. “This is lovely.” Staley was always working when she was at past Olympics. As a player, she won gold at the 1996 Atlanta Olympics, the 2000 Sydney Games and again in Athens in 2004. After her playing days, she turned her attention to coaching. Staley was an assistant on the 2008 and the 2016 teams, before becoming the head coach of the gold medal-winning women’s team at the Tokyo Games three years ago. In Paris, it’s been a pleasure trip. “There’s no pressure,” Staley said, “and I am seeing everything” as she rattled several events including fencing, water polo, track and field and of course, basketball. “I wasn’t able to do this before because I was always competing.” And yes, she did some work in Paris as well. South Carolina is still looking for games to fill out its schedule for this coming season. So, Staley went on social media on Friday to see if anyone wants to play her powerhouse program. But on Saturday, it was back to vacation. And when the U.S. women’s soccer team won gold by beating Brazil, Staley won a bet with former Gamecocks star Kamila Cardoso — saving her from having to wear a Brazil jersey for a South Carolina game. “It's been an awesome time,” Staley said.

celebrates with family. REUTERS/Dylan Martinez Breanna Stewart says no to coaching her kids—Is she right to draw the line? Breanna Stewart remembers the moment very well. She stood on the court just after winning her second WNBA championship with the Seattle Storm, feeling an overwhelming sense of accomplishment. But with confetti falling around her, she felt like her mind was already in the future. It was a realization that marked her foray into entrepreneurship—a path as vital to her identity now as her storied basketball career. Estimated to have a net worth of $5 million, Stewart recently was candid about her WNBA experiences, entrepreneurial adventures, and why she doesn’t see herself coaching her kids. Despite being deeply involved in basketball, Stewart made quite a revelation by saying she has no intention of coaching her kids. In the interview, she said, “You want to be able to be in your community; you want to be able to be with your kids or coach your kids—I don’t want to coach my kids, but people want to do that.” Apart from her very successful WNBA career, Stewart has also expanded into entrepreneurship. She recently shared the motivation for starting a business: she said she just knew she needed to have something outside of playing basketball that would keep her interest. “Starting a business was important for me,” Stewart said. “I hope this business goes many years beyond when I’m playing. It’s an opportunity for others to see you can have your job and also be an amazing entrepreneur. You can do both.” ADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad     A post shared by Stewie (@breannastewart30) Breanna Stewart just dropped a bombshell—no coaching her kids! React! Reactions   Her entrepreneurial ventures further display her desire to leave behind a legacy beyond her playing years. Stewart’s approach is not solely about making money but about being able to inspire others to follow their passions as well, parallel to having a primary career. Business acumen, combined with athletic prowess, makes her an unstoppable force in both the sports and business worlds. ADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad Breanna Stewart’s WNBA career has been nothing but utterly amazing. Chosen first overall by the Connecticut Sun in the 2016 WNBA Draft, she compiled a long list of accolades, including two WNBA MVP awards in 2018 and 2023 and two championships with the Seattle Storm in 2018 and 2020. On-court excellence over time made her one of the most valued players in the league, coupled with an amazing list of achievements that underlined her dominance. Aside from his on-court success, Stewart has grown into an enormous figure in the sports marketing world. She has grown, with endorsement deals for Nike, Puma, and AT&T, from only the basketball world to one of the most marketable athletes in women’s sports. Her move to the New York Liberty has done much to raise her profile as she continues to further her talents on the grand stage. Her contributions have not only heightened their level of performance but also raised her teammates’ level of performance, thereby increasing her visibility and further cementing her position as one of the most influential athletes in the women’s game of basketball. The very fact that Stewart has opted to move out of coaching her children proves that she deeply understands the high demands that professional coaching requires and, more importantly, how to strike a balance between her personal and professional lives. While many athletes go into coaching after playing, Stewart has decided to pursue other interests, such as business, community service, and activism. For instance, the leadership she provided in the “Togethxr” initiative, which she co-founded with other high-profile female athletes, speaks to her making a committed effort toward women’s empowerment through sports and media.

33,Carolyn Swords,A grand moment for Carolyn Swords: Her No. 30 soars to the rafters at Boston College,https://www.bostonglobe.com/2023/01/22/sports/grand-moment-carolyn-swords-her-no-30-soars-rafters-boston-college/,"Carolyn Swords was a force on the basketball court at Boston College, the first woman in  program history to rack up 2,000-plus points and 1,000-plus rebounds in her stellar run from 2007-11. On Sunday afternoon, BC raised her No. 30 to the rafters at halftime of the Eagles’  home game against Clemson. The Sudbury native is the second BC women’s basketball player to have her jersey retired, joining Sarah Behn (2003). Her three siblings and their families, plus family friends, high school teammates and college teammates congregated at Conte Forum to celebrate. “I’m incredibly humbled,” Sword said after being recognized. “Sarah Behn is a name that we all [know] — especially coming up in Massachusetts basketball, like, she’s a legend, and so to have my jersey join hers (No. 33) is incredible.” Advertisement A 6-foot-6-inch post player, Swords sits second on the Eagles’ all-time scoring list behind only Behn (2,523) with 2,029 career points. During her college career , Swords set team highs in rebounds (1,159), blocks (178), and games played (133). After finishing at BC, Swords then went on to be the No. 15 overall pick to the Chicago Sky in the 2011 WNBA Draft. She played nine seasons with the Sky, New York Liberty, Seattle Storm and Las Vegas Aces, coming out of a brief retirement in 2020 to then help Vegas make the WNBA Finals. Swords also added overseas stints in Europe and Australia. “I’m just thrilled by the love and support, and the trust that I had from my family, my friends, and then my teammates who passed me the ball,” Swords said. “Just happy I could put it in the basket for them a couple times.” Now 33, Swords currently works for Nike as an associate product line manager, helping in the company’s Nike By You custom footwear department. She hasn’t closed the door on returning to basketball in a coaching capacity, but is proud of the work she’s currently doing with the apparel giant. Several youth basketball programs, including groups from Scituate, Lexington, and other areas of the state, also came out to support Swords. Once a Division 2 state champion at Lincoln-Sudbury High, she’s now joined Behn and the legends before her as stewards of Massachusetts’ basketball history. Advertisement “It’s really special that, because I came here [to BC] and am from here originally, I get to share this with so much of my hometown and everyone who supported me growing up,” Swords said.

34,Penny Taylor,Taylor Swift's cat Olivia Benson has a higher net worth than Travis Kelce,https://pagesix.com/2024/01/07/entertainment/taylor-swifts-cat-olivia-benson-has-a-higher-net-worth-than-travis-kelce/,"Travis Kelce may be worth a pretty penny, but it doesn’t hold a candle to girlfriend Taylor Swift’s net worth — or her cats. Olivia Benson, the “Lover” singer’s feline whom she adopted in 2014, is one of the world’s richest cats with an estimated net worth of $97 million. According to a Forbes-style list of the world’s wealthiest pets compiled by the website AllAboutCats.com last week, the Scottish Fold “earned her fortune starring alongside her owner in several music videos.”  The cat, named after Mariska Hargitay’s “Law & Order: SVU” character, has also “crafted her own merchandise line, and has had cameos in many big-budget ads, including for the likes of Diet Coke and Ned Sneakers,” the website noted. The Kansas City Chiefs tight end, for his part, has an estimated 2024 net worth of $40 million. Several fans took to TikTok in the wake of Olivia Benson’s net worth reveal, comparing her fortune to that of Swift’s new man.  “If Travis is lucky, he’ll be as successful as TS’s cats one day,” one fan joked.  “her cat has exponentially more money than I’ll see in my entire existance [sic],” another chimed in, while a third wrote, “that cat has more money than my entire family 😭.”  For more Page Six you love… The two-time Super Bowl champion’s net worth is aided by several lucrative endorsement deals with companies like McDonald’s, Papa John’s, Nike and Dick’s Sporting Goods. He also makes considerable cash from his salary, as he’s currently in the third year of a four-year $57.25 million deal he signed with the Chiefs. The agreement included $22.75 million in guaranteed money, in addition to an annual salary of $14,312,500. However, Kelce has been outspoken about the fact he’s “underpaid.” “My managers and agents love to tell me how underpaid I am,” he told Vanity Fair in January 2023. “Any time I talk about wanting more money, they’re just like, ‘Why don’t you go to the Chiefs and ask them?’” he went on. “When I saw [former Chiefs receiver] Tyreek Hill go [to the Miami Dolphins] and get $30 [million] a year, in the back of my head, I was like, ‘Man, that’s two to three times what I’m making right now.’” Swift, on the other hand, is believed to be worth a whopping $740 million — and counting — per Forbes, which is more than 24 times her new beau’s fortune.

37,Kristi Toliver,"'It will happen': Mavs assistant, Sparks guard Kristi Toliver sees female NBA head coach in near future. Maybe her",https://theathletic.com/2900680/2021/10/20/it-will-happen-mavs-assistant-sparks-guard-kristi-toliver-sees-female-nba-head-coach-in-near-future-maybe-her/,"Kristi Toliver remembers going to a Dallas Mavericks game to see her favorite player, Jason Kidd. She was around 9 years old. A few years later in high school in Virginia, she wore No. 5 because of him. Fast forward a few more years and the 34-year-old WNBA star can now be found throwing balls to, giving advice to and working out with athletes like Luka Doncic as an assistant on Kidd’s Dallas Mavericks coaching staff Advertisement It’s truly been a full circle for the two-time WNBA champion and three-time All-Star. “I was a fan of his as a kid growing up. I wore No. 5 in honor of Jason. He was my favorite,” Toliver recalls with a grin. “He used to wear the armband and so I had the armband 5 too. As a point guard, his ability to see the game and read the game was just great. “This is an awesome opportunity to be with this team. For me, it was a no-brainer to be working  with Jason Kidd, especially with his leadership and I know he’s a great teacher.” Hired as a Mavs assistant coach in August, Toliver will sit on the sidelines next to the famous point guard who helped the Mavs win their only championship, and serve as a second pair of eyes for a Mavs team looking to make some noise this season, starting with Thursday’s season opener at the Hawks. Her influence will be seen “hopefully all over the place,” she says. Toliver became the 15th female assistant coach in NBA history. As a point guard for the L.A. Sparks, she’s the first active WNBA player to work as an NBA assistant. It’s not a new role for her after serving as a Wizards assistant from 2018 to 2020 when she played for the Mystics. “I’m right behind Jason, interacting with the guys. To me, I’m just another set of eyes,” she says. “What I’m seeing (on the court), I can relay that to the coaches and players because as a point guard you want as many sets of eyes on the action as you can have.” Kidd agrees. “When you look at what Kristi brings, being a player still playing, it’s incredible,” Kidd says. “She has a different view as a player today. Also she’s coached with the Wizards so she’s had experience. “She came highly recommended throughout the league when you talk about players in Washington who spoke very highly of her. Once we committed to her, I got to watch her play a little bit (before she got hurt). Just talking to her I felt she would bring a lot of value to our staff.” Advertisement Her agreement with the Mavs ensures it won’t interfere with her WNBA career, according to reports. Playing in L.A. and coaching in Dallas is different than her previous WNBA-NBA duties as a player and coach for different organizations in the same city. But Toliver was eager to coach again. “It kind of just happened,” she says of what brought her to Dallas. “I definitely wanted to get back into the league. I didn’t want to be out for too long, I missed it and just had the itch.” Over the summer she fielded calls from several teams seeking an assistant. “I had a lot of great conversations on the NBA level, G League level, and so yeah, I answered every phone call and this one just stuck,” Toliver says of the Mavs call with former Mavs player and current assistant general manager Michael Finley, Kidd and new Mavs GM Nico Harrison. “From the jump, it was very comfortable. I had watched them (Finley and Kidd) as players, and I know Nico through Nike so that connection from the jump was immediate,” she says. Toliver, a 12-year WNBA veteran, knows how to win. In addition to her two WNBA championships with L.A. (2016) and Washington (2019), as a freshman in 2006, she led Maryland to its first women’s basketball national championship. She’s a three-time WNBA All-Star (2013, 2018, 2019) and was the 2012 WNBA Most Improved Player. Toliver has also played professionally in Europe during the WNBA offseason and has been part of six Russian League championships. Her knowledge of the game and decades of experience make her the right person to help guide this young Mavs team. Sparks head coach Derek Fisher endorsed her NBA role. “I think, in order to be a good coach, you need an understanding of the game to some degree,” he says. “I think she’s a student of basketball; that she really loves it. So, I think those things really help.” Advertisement “I think her experience as a player really helps because she’s been in a lot of the situations that you’re talking to someone about pick-and-roll defensive situations or getting to your spots offensively and getting your shot off late in the game,” Fisher adds. “She’s been there before. So, she has all the ingredients and she’s intentional about it. She really wants to do it. I think she’s going to do very well. Her experience in Washington, I think for players in Dallas, they’ll be able to see it’s not just something she decided all of a sudden that she wanted to do. She’s been pretty clear about this for the last few years and I’m really happy for her that she’s going to have that opportunity.” Toliver’s presence, specifically as an active player, brings a unique perspective and dynamic to the Mavs. One they hope works in their favor. “She brings that championship mentality. I think she’s been great for us,” Doncic says. “She helps a lot with all the players, talking to them and so far she’s been great.” Her success is something players aspire to, they say. “She’s a champion. She’s been places where we want to go as a team; to the finals and with a ring on her finger,” says Mavs guard Jalen Brunson, one of Toliver’s “crew”  (in addition to Doncic, Dwight Powell and Dorian Finney-Smith) with whom she works directly. “So hearing her insight and hearing what she has to say — she’s very quiet — but when she speaks it’s very knowledgeable and I’m always all ears when she speaks. These past couple of weeks getting to know her and how she operates has been very helpful to me. “It’s always special when you get current or former players to speak and share their knowledge. You get people who have been in the fire to tell you about their experiences or what they think so having insight like that is very special.” Toliver calls coaching as a current player a “luxury for me” because it provides her with a new perspective on communicating and teaching. “It’s good and it helps me with my ability to communicate both here and then going back to Los Angeles,” she says. “It’s just rep on top of rep on top of rep. I already know how they are feeling and what they are seeing because I was just doing it.” 📹 Inside Training Camp Episode 3: Coaches We introduce you to @jareddudley619 and @kristitoliver, and hear how their recent careers as players have helped them shape the kind of coaches they want to be. That's a wrap on Training Camp 🎬@biosteelsports | #MFFL pic.twitter.com/U61yhbD0Yg — Dallas Mavericks (@dallasmavs) October 16, 2021  “The game is the same but my leadership style is different from say, (assistant coach Darrell Armstrong’s), and even Jason’s, and that’s the beauty of it all,” Toliver says. “That’s why having such diversity in this sport is so important because everyone can touch someone differently and I think I do that with just me being me, not even just because I’m female.” Advertisement The NBA, which celebrates its 75th anniversary this season, appeared to be moving in the direction of hiring its first female head coach this summer when San Antonio Spurs assistant coach Becky Hammon became a finalist for the Portland Trailblazers job. They eventually hired former NBA player Chauncey Billups. Currently, there are a handful of female assistant coaches in the NBA, in addition to Hammon, the longest-serving female assistant coach in NBA history who joined the Spurs in 2014. Others include Jenny Boucek with the Indiana Pacers, Teresa Witherspoon with the New Orleans Pelicans and Edniesha Curry with the Trailblazers. According to The Undefeated, 12 of the 15 female coaches joined the league after 2017 with a record 11 coaching simultaneously in 2019-20. What does Toliver think about the future of women in the NBA? “There will be a female head coach. I know the opportunities are there,” she says. “I don’t know sooner rather than later — but at some point, it will happen. There are a lot of qualified women out there. It’s just a matter of getting that opportunity — when the door comes knocking I think someone will be able to answer that call.” Could that someone be her? “Absolutely,” she says. “I’m leaving the door open, but right now I’m just finding my path and just enjoying the journey and seeing where that takes me.” In the meantime, she’s focused on helping lead the Mavs to a winning season and a long postseason run. Then she’ll return to the Sparks. She missed the last few weeks of the season with a fractured left pinkie finger, and the Sparks failed to make the playoffs. “I still have two years left on my contract and I plan on honoring that. I’ve got some years left in me,” she says of her career. “I’ve really enjoyed going from one team in D.C. back to L.A., trying to help an organization get back to where they want to be. That’s the fun part, and the challenge, but I’m enjoying it.” (Top photo courtesy of Dallas Mavs) Get all-access to exclusive stories.
