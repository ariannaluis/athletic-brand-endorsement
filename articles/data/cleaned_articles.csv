usas mens basketball team handed france a defeat in the finals the womens team did the same they defeated the host nation by a narrow 6766 margin on sunday to claim their eighth consecutive gold at the olympics despite these efforts and achievements stephen a smith believes team usa missed an opportunity and hes not apologetic for saying this on august 13th smith unveiled his perspective via his official youtube channel when you talk about marketing the sport i think team usa missed an opportunity to elevate the profile of womens excellence in the sport of basketball because they ignored marketing he said after applauding team usas women for returning with their eighth consecutive gold around their necks for smith caitlin clark was an opportunity team usa could have seized her addition to team usa would have been a marketing boost box office matters we want to act like it doesnt matter but it does he added for context 4 of team usas games over the past week drew an audience of less than 13000 meanwhile the indiana fever alone recorded about 16898 viewers per game for 11 straight since clarks arrival advertisement article continues below this ad he even pointed out how the mens basketball team is taking advantage of marketing opportunities its not an accident i saw anthony edwards with those adidas shoes or lebron james with his goldplated shoes but i saw that

captain before being relieved of his duties during the tournament and benched in the latter stages as brazil would win the competiton on the global stage for the first time in 24 years yet rais reputation always shone brightly among the brazilian public he was an adventurous player on and off the pitch who established himself as one of the most revered players in paris saintgermains history the former sao paulo was a final third fiend who would latch onto any halfchance in and out of the box and use his stocky build to his advantage rais brazil career appearances 49 goals 15 assists 1

confederation cup 2005 2009 brazil have been blessed with some remarkable defenders including cafu and roberto carlos neymars career with brazil shouldnt be understated he hasnt won a world cup or secured a copa america despite coming close in 2021 but since the age of 18 when he first put on a selecao shirt he has performed to an individual level not many have ever reached for the nation mainly a leftsided player at the club level a role on the inside as a more traditional 10 is where neymar has operated in brazil sides emphasising his central role in any brazlian coach plans especially dungas loathe or love him being the countrys highestever goal scorer and winning brazils first olympic gold medal in rio in 2016 warrants his inclusion on this list as the stillmodern

Stephen Curry,Fact Check: Did Stephen Curry Make McDonald's France Remove Classic Menu Item?,https://www.essentiallysports.com/nba-active-basketball-news-fact-check-did-stephen-curry-make-mcdonald-s-france-remove-classic-menu-item/,more sports es fancast aug 12 2024 918 am edt via reuters paris 2024 olympics basketball mens victory ceremony bercy arena paris france august 10 2024 gold medallist stephen curry of united states bites his medal reutersevelyn hockstein via reuters paris 2024 olympics basketball mens victory ceremony bercy arena paris france august 10 2024 gold medallist stephen curry of united states bites his medal reutersevelyn hockstein did stephen curry really make mcdonalds france change their menu whats your take on this wild rumor for over 15 years now stephen curry has been an influential figure in american basketball by winning four championship titles setting himself as the alltime threepointer leader and winning several accolades he has become a household name domestically the 2024 paris olympics gave him the opportunity to prove his worth on the international stage as well as he led team usa to his fifth consecutive gold medal however was his influence in the olympics strong enough to consider bringing about a change in the menu of frances mcdonalds as it turns out the answer is yes although it was not something that the player personally set out to do in the aftermath of the finals of the mens basketball tournament between team usa and france the official instagram handle of mcdonalds france uploaded a post carrying a picture of their classic curry sauce as a joke a caption was placed right on top of the sauce that read pour des raisons evidentes on songe a retirer cette sauce which literally translates to for obvious reasons we are considering removing this sauce another caption was put on the side that stated pour 4 ans minimum for at least 4 years it wouldnt have taken a genius to put two and two together to understand the context behind this post stephen curry initially struggled to make a mark during the paris olympics he blamed it on the fiba rules and standards that were quite different from the ones established by the nba however he boldly put his ultimate prowess on display during the semifinals against serbia which team usa was on the brink of losing the 36yearold repeated his actions during the final as well by securing a score of 24 points 1 rebound and 5 assists against france as he went 813 with his field goals and 812 with his threepointers advertisement article continues below this ad four of those faraway shots were made in a consecutive manner within the final 3 minutes by the time the gold medal was in his hand the golden state warriors star had emerged as team usas leading scorer setting an olympic record for the most threepointers made in a final game in light of this the billiondollar fastfood brand thought of cracking a joke at the expense of frances loss this is a joke in reference to yesterdays basketball game and stephen currys huge performance a spokesperson for mcdonalds france stated in an email to cnn poll 1 of 4 do you think stephen currys influence is strong enough to change mcdonalds menu absolutely no way maybe but not sure who cares have an interesting take join debate which of scottie pippens seven kids do you think will make the biggest impact in sports antron pippen scotty pippen jr preston pippen sierra pippen justin pippen sophia pippen taylor pippen have an interesting take join debate who do you think handled the anthony edwards and adidas controversy better anthony edwards adidas noah lyles usain bolt have an interesting take join debate do you think dennis rodman was a good father to alexis yes no its complicated not sure have an interesting take join debate chef curry saved team usa from a loss against serbia in the semis and was the most influential in the finals victory without him the us basketball team might have had to walk away without a medal and france might have finished on top therefore by keeping the item on their menu mcdonalds france may not have wanted to hand out a daily reminder to consumers about the man who cost them their gold however if mcdonalds wants to take the joke further they can allow the curry sauce to make an appearance in us locations with the 2028 olympics set to take place in la fans would need it to remind them of the player who brought the previous medal home stephen currys name and the name of the mcdonalds sauce are a simple coincidence but thanks to their dominance on the nba court many basketball athletes have had some specific dishes named after them some have been bestowed this honor while others have just created these food items by themselves carmelo anthony entered the nba in 2003 as part of one of the most promising draft classes of all time later on he devoted the next 19 years of his life living up to that standard securing his name in the nba allstar team on 10 occasions winning four medals three gold one bronze at the olympics and getting himself named to the nba 75 anniversary team however amongst all these accolades it would be remiss to not mention the sandwich that carnegie deli named especially in his honor introduced back in 2011 the melo is a monstrous food item it is a skyscraper of meats as it contains over 35 pounds of pastrami salami corned beef bacon and to keep the sandwich a bit healthy lettuce and tomato filling one stomach would also drain ones wallet since according to cbs news the melo cost 2195 when introduced the reasoning behind the price was based on the fact that selling 3 million of the melo sandwiches would secure 65 million in sales the same price that cost the new york knicks in its extension deal with the player during his stint with the cleveland cavaliers matthew dellavedova created a reputation for being a player who would often engage in physical antics on the court in fact according to a poll conducted by the los angeles times in 2016 he was ranked as the nbas dirtiest player despite this he had a thing not many of his peers did a burger named after him in may 2015 in order to celebrate national burger day and the cavaliers securing a perfect 40 record during the conference finals the cleveland cavaliers introduced the delly burger being sold at a concession stand outside the basketball arena the food item consisted of salami capicola provolone gritty arugula roasted peppers and a tough texture of red wine vinaigrette at 975 the burger might not have been that appealing to the eye but would have tasted different in honor of nationalburgerday east champs

kiddgilchrist was honored with a burger bearing his name at the cowfish sushi burger bar in charlotte the turkey burger consisted of a raclette spinach fried leeks and a topping of hot pepper jelly it will be rare for the nba world to see a player like shaquille oneal again on the basketball court if there is one thing that longtime fans know about him it is that the fourtime nba champion loves food as a result he set out to share his love by introducing not just one food item bearing his name but a whole restaurant founded in 2018 the big chicken restaurant chain is shaqs brainchild while it was only in 18 locations by june 2023 it is currently expanding at a rapid rate and will operate in over 300 stores soon specializing in louisianastyle fried chicken sandwiches many of the

elevate kobe bryants brand to the same legendary status as michael jordans the united states mens basketball team clinched gold for the fifth consecutive time by defeating france on saturday night in the 2024 paris olympics although busy with training for the mike tyson fight on november 15th jake paul made time to watch team usa succeed in the biggest games of the world meanwhile he came up with the idea that the sports apparel brand nike should sign more players to the kobe bryant brand such an idea is not a new thing paul came up with alonefans of the late nba legend have made similar demands in the past jake paul happens to be a more headlinefriendly sort of person its worth noting that nikes kobe brand launched in 2005 is a line of basketball shoes and other merchandise created in collaboration with bryant one of the greatest nba players of all time it includes signature sneakers apparel and accessories regardless paul wants nike to build a brand around bryant like they did for michael jordan in 1997 all this transpired on social media as paul roped in kobes wife vanessa bryant in the loop advertisement article continues below this ad while watching the summer olympics last basketball game paul hopped onto x and wrote nike needs to sign players to the kobe brand just like jordan seeing so many men and women ball players wearing kobes at the olympics 81024 lets get that gold for mamba he isnt wrong many of the olympic basketball players were sporting bryants retro nikes during many of the games is jake paul right to demand nike treat kobes brand like michael jordans react reactions a post shared by betr betr if that doesnt convince you heres more even though nikes only released retro models so far the kobe line is still the most popular performance basketball shoe out there and the good news nikes already making moves in the right direction they relaunched the kobe brand last august with more sneaker drops and mamba programs in the ncaa still nike hasnt fully created a kobe brand like jordan brand just yet plus if nike does decide to kobes wife vanessa bryant should have the final say according to jake paul after paul put his thoughts out there he soon clarified his stance adding meant with full respect and admiration of course its vanessa bryant who has to make that decision the posts were then shared together by pauls sports betting app betrs instagram page interestingly when jordan launched his sublabel in 1997 it included signing five nba players which later expanded into nfl and mlb and this isnt the first time pauls shown his love and respect for the late nba legend advertisement article continues below this ad back in january jake paul opened up about the mix of emotions he felt during his professional boxing debut which happened at a pretty tough time for sports fans on january 26 2020 the world was hit hard by the devastating news of nba legend kobe bryants tragic death along with his daughter gigi and seven others in a helicopter crash as paul was gearing up for his first pro fight that same week he couldnt help but feel the weight of the loss especially since kobe was admired worldwide for his mamba mentality and unstoppable work ethic my first pro debuts fight week started on jan 26 2020 it was a very sad way to start my boxing career since then ive looked to learn from kobe bryant work ethic mamba mentality daily legends are forever rest in peace pictwittercomubcyyvehjp jake paul jakepaul january 26 2024 expand tweet advertisement article continues below this ad in a touching post on x paul talked about how bryants legacy has been a huge inspiration for him shaping the way he approaches his boxing career even though that week was heavy with grief paul managed to push through and came out on top in his debut defeating fellow youtuber anesongib with a firstround tko looking back jake paul paid tribute to bryant recognizing how much the basketball icons influence still drives him both in life and in the ring despite the lack of a complete brand around kobe bryant every time nike drops bryant sneakers the demand is difficult to keep up with meaning its safe to say that it wont be an unprofitable endeavor for nike still whether such a thing happens is yet to be seen would you like to see nike sign players to the kobe brand essentiallysports is a digitalfirst sports media house

Pau Gasol,Team USA's Kobe Bryant forgot Pau Gasol was his Lakers teammate during 2008 Olympics and ran through him in true sign of 'Mamba Mentality',https://talksport.com/sport/1914025/team-usa-kobe-bryant-pau-gasol-lakers-olympics/,kobe bryant was known around the world as the black mamba it was moniker inspired after the late great los angeles lakers legend watched quentin tarantinos kill bill and needed something to separate himself from his oncourt persona in the film the black mamba snake known for its agility and aggressiveness was used as a code name for a deadly assassin it was nickname befitting of one of the most competitive players to ever suit up in the nba in 2008 bryant and the rest of team usa were looking for revenge four years prior theyd been embarrassed at the olympic games in athens finishing with a bronze medal 16 years earlier the original dream team led by hall of famers michael jordan charles barkley larry bird and magic johnson destroyed everyone en route to olympic gold and set the standard for all subsequent teams to aspire to while the 04 team was no dream team it was still a starstudded squad bursting with nba talent and a third place finish on the world stage was simply unforgivable team usa needed to salvage its global standing it had to reclaim gold in 2008 their solution bring in reigning mvp kobe bryant who had never played in the olympics before but was seething after an nba finals defeat to bitter rivals boston and was desperate to see the us reestablish themselves atop the international basketball food chain the redeem team had found its leader one that could take a talented but inexperienced group including carmelo anthony dwyane wade and lebron james and turn them into ruthless winners team usa headed to beijing china in the summer of 08 as the overwhelming favourites but reigning world champions spain were still the team to beat after blowout wins against china angola and greece team usa faced spain in a preliminary round game both teams were undefeated thus far 30 but one narrative in particular dominated the build up to the contest kobe vs pau earlier that year 7footer gasol had been traded to los angeles to play alongside bryant and fill the lakers shaqsized hole that had been gaping for years the bigmanlittleman combo immediately hit it off forming an potent partnership that saw them finish the season 279 and reach the nba finals ahead of the game vs spain bryant told reporters that he and gasol are like brothers and that going against each other wouldnt be easy im very happy for him that hes playing well bryant said i mean were very very tight so its a little tough to compete against him his locker room message was one of an entirely different tone kobe said he was gonna set the tone to start the game and he said im running through paus chest lebron revealed in netflixs redeem team documentary james said the us players responded man you tripping thats your teammate you tripping you aint about to do this first play of the game im running through pau gasol and we was like what dwyane wade added he said first play of the game i know what theyre gonna run and he knew pau was gonna be the last screen and he said im running through him sure enough spain ran the play bryant was expecting in the first few minutes of the contest gasol attempted to set a screen on bryant who ran straight through him at full force and knocked him over to the ground bryant was called for the foul and stood over his lakers teammate as a bewildered gasol looked around as if to check what had just happened kobe had sent a message not just to pau and spain but to his own teammates without uttering a single word he was like no he aint my teammate right now fk him get up carmelo anthony said im like i love this energy this is what we need right now he just went right into the middle of my chest tried to get right through me to send a message gasol explained in the documentary not just to me but to his teammates to say hey this might be my brother i play with him were close but i dont care about anything else but winning we was like oh aint no way were losing this game lebron added we about to beat the sht out of spain team usa went on to cruise to a 37point victory with bryant finishing with 11 points in only 16 minutes of action the united states and spain met again in the gold medal game in what turned out to be a much closer affair kobe hit big shots down the stretch and finished with 20 points as the redeem team clinched a 118107 victory bryant had set out what he achieved to do winning gold for team usa and avenging the humiliation of 2004 the way hed done it embodying his mamba mentality attacking whats in front of you with passion and purpose without fear and doubt was what made it so special inadvertently hed also helped gasol and the lakers i sincerely believed pau benefited from the collision more than anyone else michael lee of the washington post told netflix he got to see how intensely kobe approached the game and it helped him develop the mentality he was going to need to go back to back the lakers were going to be good but they wouldnt be great by being happygolucky the team from tinseltown won consecutive titles with bryant and gasol leading the way beating the magic in 2009 and the celtics in 2010 bryant rejoined the national team for the 2012 summer olympics and won another gold meal his second overall he finished his national team career with a record of 260 across three tournaments including the usa fiba americas championship winning a gold medal each time his international peak undoubtedly came in 2008 though when the entire world saw what mamba mentality was all about for gasol that was as good as if not better than anything the original dream team ever did kobe came and they brought their ateam he said i think that was probably as good or better than the potentially original dream team if you ask me gasol is one of the greatest international players in nba history winning two titles alongside bryant the spanish big man was a sixtime allstar and nba rookie of the year he also has an illustrious international career having won a fiba world cup title three eurobasket titles two olympic silver medals and an olympic bronze

Magic Johnson,"Dream Team’s Michael Jordan, Charles Barkley and Magic Johnson showed ultimate act of loyalty during ’92 Olympics with defiant act during gold medal ceremony",https://talksport.com/sport/1951106/michael-jordan-barkley-magic-dream-team-olympics-nike-reebok/,michael jordan is nike nike is michael jordan the most marketable athlete in the history of north american sports has been intertwined with the venerated swoosh brand ever since he put pen to paper on a fiveyear 25million endorsement deal in 1984 mike and nikes relationship eventually birthed the iconic air jordan sneakers a landmark shoe that became a major status symbol in footwear and streetwear culture around the globe nikes ascendancy from oregonbased shoe brand to multibillion dollar apparel corporation coincided with his airness rising to the summit of the association by 1992 twotime champion and twotime finals mvp jordan had surpassed magic johnson and larry bird as the undisputed face of the nba and was about to take his talents overseas nba initially players werent allowed to participate in the olympics but that all changed in 1989 when fiba removed the rule so in 1992 team usa head coach chuck daily assembled an avengersesqe squad bursting with nba talent that was tasked with one simple goal winning an olympic gold medal jordan magic and bird were joined by fellow hall of famers charles barkley david robinson karl malone and patrick ewing among others who descended on barcelona spain with beatleslike fanfare and with the mission of putting on a basketball clinic the starstudded squad was aptly named the dream team because of their ethereal talents and they predictably stomped on every team who dared to step in their way the consensus greatest sports team ever assembled were unbeaten en route to the gold medal that summer averaging more than 117 points per game and winning by an average margin of 44 points team usa defeated croatia 11785 in the gold medal game and nike ambassador jordan was suddenly faced with a difficult dilemma brand rival reebok had secured exclusive rights to produce warmup outfits and other apparel for american athletes including dream team members at the 92 olympics reebok reportedly paid 4 million for the rights to team usas medal stand jackets and the us olympic committee made it clear that winners had to accept medals while wearing jackets emblazoned with the reebok logo they said if we dont wear our uniforms we cant accept our gold medal jordan said at the time but it wasnt just mjs brand loyalties that were about to be tested of the 12 dream team members none were reebok endorsers while six including jordan and barkley were nike athletes us cocaptains magic and bird were longtime converse advocates something had to give and it was increasingly apparent that none of the players were about to jeopardize highly lucrative sponsorship deals by rocking a rival brand in front of millions of eyes and so as they went up to the podium to receive their gold medals all 12 dream team players unzipped their jackets so that the collars obscured the reebok sponsor patch jordan the trailblazer that he is went one step further the chicago bulls legend covered the reebok logo on the right shoulder by draping himself in the red white and blue of the american flag they cant hide it like im gonna hide it jordan said they in for a big fing surprise barkley and magic were the only other players who followed suit and covered the reebok insignia with the american flag us nike guys are loyal to nike because they pay us a lot of money sir charles told reporters at the time i have 2 million reasons not to wear reebok jordan barkley and magics defiant stance worked like a charm there wasnt a reebok patch in sight when the starspangled banner rang out around the spanish arena straight after the medal ceremony had taken place jordan tossed the reebok jacket to brian mcintyre a member of the nbas public relations squad telling him he could have it i certainly dont want it he told mcintyre mcintyre looked after the jacket which has a patch that reads reebok is proud to honor americas finest for two years thinking jordan would eventually want it back in 1994 mcintyre bumped into mj at an event and tried to hand the item back to him instead jordan signed it to brian thanks for everything michael jordan mcintyre kept the jacket for nearly 30 years it remains a timeless piece of basketball memorabilia and in 2023 sold through sothebys for 15 million the jacket is so much more than just a piece of memorabilia though its an important artefact that serves as a powerful reminder of the enduring strength of brand jordan and his unparalleled impact on sports fashion and culture everyone agreed we would not deface the reebok on the award uniform jordan said of the decision to cover up the jacket at the time the american flag cannot deface anything thats what we stand for the american dream is standing up for what you believe in i believed in it and i stood up for it if i offended anyone thats too bad when you hire 12 clint eastwoods to come in

anthony edwards also made it to the roster the issue arose when derrick white was sent as kawhis replacement instead of jaylen brown 2016 gold medallist kyrie irving was also excluded with 8 years younger tyrese haliburton despite the uproar and draymond criticizing his own gsw coach another exwarrior believes that what happened was for the best demarcus cousins and quinn cook discussed tyrese haliburtons inclusion in the team usa roster quinn initiated the topic stating you need a guy whos not gonna be mad when not playing this was an indirect dig at jaylen brown as the team usa roster was reportedly concerned whether someone of jaylen browns caliber would accept having a significantly reduced role therefore with the team filled with dominating scorers like lebron kd etc the need was for a player who wouldnt mind staying on the sidelines obviously jaylen brown kyrie irving from a talent perspective and what theyve done even with their resumes theyre supposed to be on the team but

minutes being used up to add only 4 points in the finals against serbia in contrast lebron james has averaged 205 minutes at the paris olympics while kevin durant just 196 therefore irvings previous record of taking up a bulk of the minutes which may or may not generate the required points may have played a role in his exclusion after jaylen brown hinted that his exclusion from team usa was because of his sour relationship with nike the teams managing director grant hill was quick to come out with a response he went on to state that the responsibility that i have is to put together a team and a team that complements each other he had to decide on these grounds even if it meant not taking in finals mvp as highlighted by quinn cook the management simply may not have believed that

complications arose jaylen brown sided with kyrie irving he spoke out against nike dropping kyrie said mccants nike dropped kyrie after the post jaylen brown didnt like that i think he was the

Blake Griffin,“Blake Griffin... Was Like a Monster”: Shaq’s Former Agent Says Michael Jordan Talk Not Anthony Edwards’ Biggest Concern,https://www.essentiallysports.com/nba-active-basketball-news-blake-griffin-was-like-a-monster-shaqs-former-agent-says-michael-jordan-talk-not-anthony-edwards-biggest-concern/,more sports es fancast jun 14 2024 915 am edt anthony edwards season ended in the western conference finals but by all accounts he had a breakout year and how comparisons to michael jordan started following him everywhere its not about his stunning vertical scary offensive maneuvers or even trash talk charismatic confidence and the talent to back it up are very subtle jordanesque traits he displays hes played it humble on the mj topic so far but you can see him riding on it or at least social media cant look past it his kobe bryantinspired adidas campaign gave jordan vibes to most but is it taking away from ants identity vishal kolar asked leonard armato the brandbuilder to the pros like shaq just that on his second sitdown with essentiallysports its easy to throw out mj comparisons but kolar asked if this is damaging to antmans brand and his dreams to be the future face of the league as per armato its a fine line armato i dont think he has to take the bait on it if people want to compare him to michael jordan let em all he has to do is say jordan is one of a kind and i have ultimate respect for him i think anthony edwards is sort of a different kind of guy fun young certainly youthful in so many different aspects of his personality explosive and incredibly fun to watch advertisement article continues below this ad edwards has the desire to be the face of the league in all aspects hes getting there but it wont be immediately jordan was a star before the championships but it was only when he led the chicago bulls to the finals for the first time that national networks took the nba as a primetime commodity expanded sponsorships and even influenced fashion when it could be said that his airness was the true face of the league before edwards can get there he has to be consistent and healthy armato itll be interesting to see how his career evolves he hasnt gotten to the promised land yet he certainly is looking forward to getting there i dont know if it will be this year but if he perseveres if he stays healthy he could have an incredible career but you dont know i mean look people get injured at times you never know look at blake griffin the guy was like a monster and then he had those injuries and really did debilitate him theres a lot of people whove suffered injuries especially high flyers and youve seen some of the things hes done its scary i mean hes fallen on his back blocking shots and youre wondering if hes okay so lets just see how this thing evolves certainly hes super fun to watch hes a charismatic kid and you know underneath it all hes a bit in his showoff stuff but at the same time i think hes got a good heart and hes a good kid and people really like him armato is right that the high flyers like edwards are at high risk hes been severely prone to injuries but when push comes to shove he cannot sit down he has to perform and lead his team edwards embraces the pain and plays through that with the bravest of smiles hip injuries twisting his ankle fingers and knees anything and everything yet he puts his best foot forward on the court advertisement article continues below this ad during game 6 against the denver nuggets edwards had a scary fall on his back they won game 6 and assured fans hed still play the wolves won the series in game 7 and armato was looking forward to the conference finals at the time of the interview which they ended up losing even though minnesota fans were disappointed by that defeat fans still had a lot of fun watching him play armato elevates edwards good heart which not enough people talk about hes engaging in an interview and not a braggart as he seems on court antman initially accepted the mj talk gracefully but in may he flat out said i want it to stop he explained his reasoning hes the greatest of all time i cant be compared to him advertisement article continues below this ad even the greatest arent immune though michael jordan was 22 during the infamous broken foot season in 1985 edwards entered the nba at 19 and is 22 now making veterans reminisce rookie jordan you dont have to rewatch the last dance to know it wasnt easy for jordan to overcome that setback and very few have replicated such a comeback the comparisons will be nothing unless edwards maintains his physical condition and longevity essentiallysports is a digitalfirst sports media

Wesley Sneijder,The Man United transfer saga involving ex-Real Madrid ace Jose Mourinho loved who 'could have been as good as Lionel Messi',https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/transfer-news/manchester-united-sneijder-scholes-ferguson-27577462,manchester united have been embroiled in their fair share of transfer sagas even in his short time in the old trafford hot seat erik ten hag has encountered such issues with his prolonged pursuit of frenkie de jong rarely far from the back pages but ultimately unsuccessful some other names have become almost running jokes among the fanbase as the reds have been linked with them every time the transfer window opens there was a time when wesley sneijder fell into that category at the time paul scholes was heading into the twilight of his career the class of 92 graduate was heading for a career break in 2011 before coming out of retirement in 2012 for 18 months sir alex ferguson knew a replacement would need to be brought to the club also read ten hag needs to solve a problem ferguson admitted to having at united during this period sneijder was one of the most gifted and talked about midfielders in world football evening once claiming he could have been as good as lionel messi and cristiano ronaldo he had helped jose mourinhos inter milan win the treble in the 200910 season before playing an important role in the netherlands run to the world cup final with uniteds need for a new central midfielder and sneijders reputation its no surprise that the reds were linked with a move in july 2011 the daily mail ran a story regarding the dutchman which stated he had agreed a 35m transfer a month later the move was off but where does the truth lie regarding the sneijder to united transfer saga men sport has taken a look in the eyes of uniteds legendary manager a deal for sneijder was never on the table during uniteds preseason tour of the us in 2011 ferguson told espn i keep reading about this theres absolutely nothing at all to that the blunt response to a transfer rumour from ferguson was no surprise the boss never had time for gossip indeed the scot doubled down on his reply 10 years later thats come up a lot of times but we were never interested in sneijder he explained i dont know where that came from but you get a lot of them sneijder has a very different recollection of uniteds reported interest in him shortly after joining galatasaray in 2013 the midfielder opened up on the legendary manager having talks with his team we had some talks with alex ferguson back in 2010 he told galatasaray dergisi united contacted them inter after our treble season but too much money was asked for and i was also happy at inter so i decided to stay manchester united are a fantastic club and they kept showing interest after that year but not as determined as before i dont give much thought about proposed transfers if im happy somewhere im happy there fast forward to 2023 and sneijder had passed the blame away from inter and towards his own agent well actually i was close in 2011 sneijder told sportbible i was close in 2011 after the champions league and after the world cup but then what i heard later is that because at a certain point we were talking with united and at a certain point there was nothing anymore uniteds adidas home shirt is made up of the same colour of the citys iconic red rose and features a black collar the collar also features a dash of both red and white giving it a slick and modernised look prices start from 55 and i asked my manager what happened with united and he said no nothing its over but two years later i found out that he asked for extra money for himself so thats why the deal was over so actually ferguson he told one of my relatives as always with transfer speculation the truth lies somewhere in the middle interest from united at the time does make sense sneijder fit the bill for what ferguson would have wanted however it is also likely the deal never got close if sneijders agent was looking for a bigger cut than was being agreed ferguson was renowned for having little time for agents who were for want of a better phrase too big for their boots if what sneijder explained regarding his manager was true it is unsurprising ferguson never saw the midfielder as a solid addition to the squad like with many stars the dutchmans failed move is another what if moment in uniteds storied history follow the mens united coverage on tiktok and youtube and subscribe to

orleans pelicans at smoothie king center mandatory credit stephen lewusa today sports is nikes latest ja morant leak a marketing genius or a complete disaster the memphis grizzlies and all their fans are eagerly waiting for the 202425 season to start with a slew of unfortunate incidents to their franchise superstar and other key players the grizzlies could never catch a break but now with the latest update on ja morant it seems like the season cant start soon enough in the meantime morant has no plans of leaving his fans stranded as the photos of his latest kicks have taken the internet by storm the nike ja 2 stargazer truly does justice to the name as opposed to his lowtop ja 1 the latest shoes feature a higher cut in addition the ripple effect detail around the swoosh tends to naturally draw the customers eyes to the vibrant purple colorway couple that with the rumored 120 price point its sure to sell like hotcakes thoughts on ja morants new shoe ja morants upcoming nike ja 2 has recently surfaced online in a stargazer colorway nicekickshoops the pair is rumored to be releasing in october for 120 nicekicks posted on instagram advertisement article continues below this ad a post shared by nice kicks nicekicks the nike ja 1 officially hit the markets in early 2023 almost a 15year gap certainly makes sense given the year morants had hence this news comes like a breath of fresh air however coach taylor jenkins provided a health update on ja morant just a few days earlier during a recent summer league broadcast jenkins confirmed that ja was indeed cleared for full basketball activities ja its go time so very encouraged medically cleared full go crossed all the hurdles hes been phenomenal with his rehab now its full go basketball with him with all the contact now its been more on the body getting that back in the right spot but now hes full go basketballwise we can dive into his basketball plan he said from his 25game suspension for brandishing a gun to the labrum tear during practice the season had effectively ended for the 24yearold memphis had seen a steady rise in their rankings in the nine games morant played in between unfortunately that was it as the grizzlies finished 13th in the west but as mentioned above fans cant help but be excited to see their young franchise star out on the court even so there are still a few unhappy fans on instagram who look nonetoopleased with his stargazer straight off the bat this fan put forward a serious argument nike design team and creativity need to have a meeting because seriously this shoe looks like a lebron mixed with a kobe lol in all honesty glimpses of probably lebron xxi and maybe kobe 5 can be seen this next fan had one more name to add to the list kobeslebronssabrina 2s ja 2 a simple straightforward equation which unfortunately once again hits the mark theres no denying that the details from these three iconic kicks can be found in ja 2 the prominent swoosh and distinct patterns not to mention the alluring purple colorway do not help nikes case in the least in fact another user has come up with quite a theory for such similarities all the kobe kyrie model that got scrapped getting revamped we dont have to tell you the aftermath of nike terminating their contract with dallas star guard kyrie irving for his antisemitic comments so that subtle dig was also included here advertisement article continues below this ad andrew dutton a sneaker photographer voiced a complaint that many annoyed fans of the global apparel brand would relate to nothing original coming from nike basketball rn however this last comment from an individual might leave the nike pr team confused as to whether it was complimentary or insulting or at just the fine line between the two how different are yall expecting a shoe its 20 something lebrons and 12 kobes and yall expecting a whole new silhouette and design weve never seen do the shoes look nice or not well well leave

Steve Nash,List of top 5 Canadian players of all time,https://www.thestar.com/sports/doug-smiths-sports-blog/raptors-mailbag-my-list-of-top-five-canadian-players-of-all-time/article_3be2be42-361e-11ef-9bba-631e3e9dfb20.html,based on the authors interpretations and judgments of facts data and events with canada day weekend upon us a readers asks who we think are the greatest canadian basketball players ever with canada day weekend upon us a readers asks who we think are the greatest canadian basketball players ever canadas shai gilgeousalexander drives around argentinas facundo campazzo at the fiba basketball world cup 2023 americas qualifiers in victoria in 2022 its a somewhat abbreviated ye olde mailbag this week i guess not enough happened and everyones getting ready for the canada day holiday enjoy it and im sure therell be tons to ask about next week after the nba free agency period opens q hi doug not sure what you are planning for the canada day weekend mailbag i hope you personally get a lot of loafing time in but given the holiday and the emergence of canada as a country that produces a whole lot of really great basketball players how about a top 5 list of the best canadian basketball players ever happy canada day to you and yours msg a thats a tough one because it covers so many eras and playing styles but without regard to position i go with steve nash shai gilgeousalexander jamal murray leo rautins and jay triano im sure im missing an obvious one or two but its early in the morning as i type and ive only had coffee q hey doug now that the draft is done i assume youre preparing for all kinds of drama during the coming free trade frenzy or maybe no drama at all watching the draft we were constantly told that team x was on the board and had five minutes to submit their choice what happens if the team does not announce their selection within the allotted time do they forfeit their pick there are 30 teams in the league with 30 firstround picks but only 58 secondround picks why of the four draft picks the raptors selected do you expect all four to spend the whole year in mississauga while no one today knows how they will develop over the coming months which ones do you think are likely to spend some considerable time with the raptors philip u a i ended up typing short stories on my phone while a passenger to a family wedding friday night and that wasnt even before free agency starts this has already been busy yes if teams blow the time allotment the pick is forfeited but i cant recall it ever happening and im sure thered be a 20second warning issued to each team close to the deadline two teams phoenix and philadelphia lost their secondround picks as part of penalties for free agency misfeasance last summer i fully expect jakobe walter and jonathan mogbo to be with the raptors for the entire season maybe a game or two in the g league but thats about it jamal shead and ulrich chomche will see some g league action i bet q a bit late but i wanted to flag your insightful insider piece about the complicated personnel decisions re pascal siakam and og anunoby im as guilty as anyone in ascribing this purely to finances so thanks for the deeper perspective with 5000 other victorians i avoided the nba draft thanks to the senior womens national team and portugal with a 12person olympic roster there are some excellent canadian players who will not be going to paris perhaps a couple of remarkable teenagers will be deemed too youthful it was fun to watch coach victor lapea experiment with lineups and tactics a power forward seemed to have a brief stint at point guard not in victoria was someone who will assuredly be going bridget carleton who as they say has taken a leap in her fifth professional season best exemplified by her monster performance earlier this week in something called the commissioners cup perhaps she is more confident or her team is much better or both but she is having a terrific wnba season dare i say that the patient rebuild of the minnesota lynx supplies as good a model as any for the raptors in the next few years james a victoria a i didnt see the game thanks to the nba draft but i heard they looked good portugals not exactly a global power though and there was some experimenting going on makes sense too to find who can do what the full team 12 players and alternates is being announced tuesday it will include the four wnbaers im told and eight you saw in victoria q hi doug no nba games no nba news right ok not entirely true im sure there are lots of questions about all the new raptors additions so i wont add to the pile but i did want to ask a few other questions 1 last week you briefly mentioned that dalano banton as a member of the celtics team for the majority of the season would be eligible for a championship ring does that mean some former raptors in a similar situation have rings delon wright cj miles anyone else did jonas valanciunass injury mean he didnt play enough games to qualify 2 read a great article echoing a point that you made about zack edey and many other drafted players critics focus too much on the negatives and forget about the positive qualities of the player as a result like the 2013 draft this one was labelled as weak because of no clear frontrunners rudy gobert cant play offence giannis antetokounmpo is too raw neither jalen brunson or nikola jokic are elite athletes etc fair assessments to a degree but missed the big picture thoughts 3 do you have any idea how early nba scouts start paying attention to players obviously ncaa and prestigious high school tournaments but beyond that the odd news stories about sevenfoot tall sixth graders etc thanks for all the predraft articles i love summer league one of the earliest indicators of how well teams really drafted bernie m a teams can decide what they want to do to honour or include in celebrations anyone on the roster at any point in the championship the raptors did not give rings to valanciunas wright or miles which i understand is the norm i admit i wasnt sure edey was an nba player at the start of the season seeing him at the combine live and talking to people with teams that worked him out i became convinced he was teams start putting together dossiers on kids in the midteens through such things as the mcdonalds allstar game the nike world event and various bigticket aau tournaments q do you have a list of names that we will probably see playing in the summer league games for the raptors you mentioned in this forum a couple of months ago that grady dick was a probable still true paul m a im typing this early saturday morning before heading home from a wedding and havent got the full roster i wouldnt be surprised if we have it by the time you read this sunday i dont know about dick but my guess is hed be in vegas to workout with the group but not play in games q hi doug do you know if the raptors made an attempt to trade for josh giddey hes still so very young and i imagine he spends all summer working on his jump shot he better be working on his jump shot all summer long richard f a i am not 100 per cent sure but i be shocked if they even made a call they were always going to pay immanuel quickley as the starter and giddey would probably be an expensive backup plus im in the category of not entirely sure about how good he is doug smith is a sports reporter based

Colin Kaepernick,"Eight years on, Colin Kaepernick waits for NFL call: 'I could help win a Championship'",https://www.skysports.com/nfl/news/12118/13195418/eight-years-on-colin-kaepernick-waits-for-nfl-call-i-could-help-win-a-championship,nfl colin kaepernick believes he could still help a side win a championship in the nfl it has been eight years since he last played he helped the san francisco 49ers to their first super bowl since 1994 but has not competed since 2016 reporting from paris monday 12 august 2024 1913 uk please use chrome browser for a more accessible video player former nfl quarterback colin kaepernick believes he could help a franchise win a championship if he played in the sport again despite an eightyear absence kaepernick spent six years with the san francisco 49ers helping them to their first super bowl since 1994 during the 2012 season but has not competed in the nfl since 2016 were still training still pushing kaepernick told sky sports news so hopefully weve just got to get one of these team owners to open up its something ive trained my whole life for so to be able to step back on the field i think that would be a major moment a major accomplishment for me i think i could bring a lot to a team and help them win a championship in august 2016 and during his final season with the san francisco 49ers kaepernick began kneeling during the pregame national anthem in the nfl to protest racial injustice and police brutality taking a knee made headlines globally and still happens in sports all over the world including before certain matches during the premier league and wsl seasons at the time two days after pledging to donate 1m to community organisations kaepernick said the message is that we have a lot of issues in this country that we need to deal with latest nfl headlines and highlights stream the nfl and more with now final olympic medal table external how kaepernick first started taking a knee we have a lot of people that are oppressed we have a lot of people that arent treated equally that arent given equal opportunities kaepernick said speaking at nikes art of victory exhibition in partnership with the pompidou centre at the olympic games kaepernick said he would continue to kneel until justice is served the protests spread across the nfl in september 2016 and during the first week of the season 11 players from the west to east coast protested taking a knee also began happening in the nwsl with worldcup winning footballer megan rapinoe kneeling during a national anthem in september 2016 and saying we need to have a more thoughtful twosided conversation about racial issues in this country the then uspresident barack obama also spoke about kaepernicks actions and said hes exercising his constitutional right to make a statement i think there are a lot of ways you can do it when it comes to the flag and national anthem the nfl reports that more than 20 million people are currently playing flag football across 100 countries with the fiveversusfive version of american football a noncontact sport that is played by people of all ages the next olympic games take place in los angeles in 2028 and flag football is one of the sports set to be introduced for the first time something kaepernick would love to be a part of hopefully well be out there he said were going to work out some things see if we can make it in there would love to be out there at the paris olympics kaepernick watched usa fight back from a 13point deficit against serbia in the semifinals of the mens basketball and said it was a phenomenal game to be able to be at the usa won their fifth consecutive olympic gold medal in a thrilling game against hosts france on saturday who they beat 9887 with lebron james scoring 14 points as he won his fourth olympic medal and third gold steph curry led the way to the win scoring 24 while devin booker and kevin durant the first fourtime mens gold medallist in olympic basketball history scored 15 each hopefully they team usa continue to build on their legacy but we have some of the alltime greats on this team he said you have a lot of players who are more on the tailend of their career but also performing at levels that we just havent seen players do at their ages when you get to see competitors who compete against each other their whole career get to team up and actually play together so to be able to see the dynamic of lebron steph kd kevin durant joel embiid taytum d booker theyve got the full squad out there theyre all allstars and for me i think about how you even put a team together like these are the five that are at any given moment i dont want to be the one making that decision because everybodys so talented kaepernick was in paris running the 10km in the marathon for all in partnership with nike along with olympic champions caster semenya and mo farah the event allowed amateurs to tackle the olympic marathon course the night between the mens and womens races sky sports has officially launched and will be integrated into sky tv streaming service now

the run it back on fanduel tv live with cohosts michelle beadle shams charania lou williams and chandler parsons when asked who he thinks the goat is manziels answer left everyone stunned instead of picking from popular choices like tom brady and patrick mahomes he namedropped former atalanta falcons legend micheal vick vick was a heisman trophy winner like manziel in 1999 and was considered a dualthreat quarterback during the interview manziel jokingly backed his belief that micheal vick known for his electrifying playing style and unparalleled athleticism deserves the title of the goat

manziel explained but how can you not love vick hes a gamechanger you have to win six seven super bowls to beat brady vick changed the game some fans argued in the comments that vicks career remained

funds etfs bonds in this article nike ceo john donahoe appears to be on thin ice the former top executive of ebay who has been at the helm of nike since january 2020 is starting to lose wall streets confidence after the company capped off a lackluster fiscal year with more bad news on thursday nike warned that sales in its current quarter were expected to decline by a staggering 10 far worse than the 32 drop lseg had projected after it posted its slowest annual sales gain in 14 years excluding the covid19 pandemic the company also said it expects fiscal 2025 sales to be down midsingle digits when it previously expected them to grow the warning signs led shares to close 20 lower on friday making it the worst trading day in the companys history since its ipo in dec 1980 the plunge wiped about 28 billion off of nikes market cap bringing it to just under 114 billion from 142 billion a day earlier as wall street digested the dismal outlook from the worlds largest sportswear company at least six investment banks downgraded nikes stock analysts at morgan stanley and stifel took it a step further specifically calling the companys management into question the fy25 guide the 5th downward consensus revision in 6 quarters pushes prospects for growth inflection further into 2025 perhaps fy4q or spring 25 at the earliest asking investors to both underwrite success of not yet proven styles and look across an uncertain consumer discretionary backdrop into 2hcy24 until momentum could build again into 2hcy25 wrote stifel analyst jim duffy management credibility is severely challenged and potential for clevel regime change adds further uncertainty since donahoe took over as nikes top executive its stock is down more than 25 as of fridays close significantly underperforming both the sp 500 and the xrt the retailfocused etf which saw gains of around 67 and 66 in that time period respectively nike finance chief matt friend on thursday attributed the guidance cut to a host of factors some like softness in china and challenging foreign exchange headwinds are outside of nikes control but others are problems it squarely created under donahoes leadership the company is expecting wholesale orders to be slow as it scales new styles pulls back on classic franchises and works to repair its relationships with key retail partners after spending the last few years cutting them off in favor of a directselling strategy at the same time loyal customers who shop on nikes website are no longer springing for new pairs of air force 1s air jordan 1s or dunks the companys core franchises critics say the sneaker lines have dominated the retailers offerings for too long and turned customers away as they sought fresh styles and innovative designs from a slew of upstart competitors thats left nike to win back some of its most essential customers runners as the retailer focused on its directselling strategy at the expense of innovation scrappy competitors like on running and hoka snatched up market share it was almost silly towards the end of the call they talked about running being such a key sport that consumers are taking part in weve known that for a long time weve known that the consumer changed their mind postpandemic how theyre much more active jessica ramrez senior research analyst at jane hali associates told cnbc adding a management change at nike is quite needed postlockdown we saw that the consumer did adopt running and was serious about that and there was an everyday runner and nike didnt really respond to that she said i think when you have management missing key consumer shifts theres a problem with your company something changed and theyve missed the mark kevin mccarthy a senior research analyst at neuberger berman told cnbcs scott wapner on thursday that the company needs a change in management and speculated that donahoes employment contract could soon expire everything that youve suggested is wrong with this company seems to flow back to execution management and everything else mccarthy said on cnbcs closing bell theyve got a couple internal candidates right now that are very capable youve got a couple exnike candidates too that have been in the discussion and then you also have other competitors that have been discussed but i do think that its assumed that the leadership of this company will be changing over the next six months in fairness to donahoe the covid19 pandemic started in earnest in the us less than two months into his tenure and hes had to grapple with shuttered stores remote workers and a rollercoaster ride of shifting consumer preferences and abilities while the companys stock may be down nikes annual sales have grown some 37 under his leadership from 374 billion in fiscal 2020 to 5136 billion in fiscal 2024 if you ask phil knight nikes founder and its chairman emeritus donahoe is doing just fine i have seen nikes plans for the future and wholeheartedly believe in them the 86yearold told cnbc in a statement i am optimistic in nikes future and john donahoe has my unwavering confidence and full support got a confidential news tip we want to hear from you sign

email is sent email has already been sent please verify your email address youve reached your account maximum for followed topics unsurprisingly the los angeles lakers search for a new head coach has been nothing short of captivating jj redick leads a pool of candidates who could take the kingdoms keys as the process of hiring a new head coach progresses a recent report has shed light on what the future coaching staff could ultimately look like according to dan woike of the los angeles times the lakers met with james borrego on wednesday and were pleased with the interview latest on the lakers coaching search borrego interviewing heard he was impressive and possible assistant coach names that people have been talking about some more likely than others although los angeles is interviewing other candidates it sounds like the head coaching job is redicks to lose at this point with redick still bound to espn through the duration of the 2024 nba playoffs the hiring likely wont happen until the finals have concluded however it appears that the lakers have begun to think about potential additions to the coaching staff that include names like scott brooks and 2x nba champion rajon rondo via los angeles times rumors of the lakers staffing plans have run throughout the league during the past two weeks with some names most commonly mentioned including former head coach scott brooks and assistants sam cassell and jared dudley woike wrote exlakers guard rajon rondo has also been under consideration according to people with knowledge of the situation not authorized to speak publicly rondo began his career with the boston celtics in 2006 in the following season he became a fulltime starter as the celtics defeated the lakers in six games that june to win the world championship in 2018 he signed with the lakers and in his second season with the team he played a key role off the bench as it won it all for years rondo has been lauded by his peers for his high basketball iq and strong feel for the game perhaps he could even make a decent head coach someday after he pays his dues as an assistant first its been widely reported james will not be involved in the lakers coaching probe given james history that statement naturally draws skepticism in april rondo called it quits after 16 seasons in the nba the 61 guards ability to push the pace facilitate attack the basket and make timely plays was indispensable to las 2020 championship squad james certainly appreciated playing with him james spoke glowingly of his former teammate one of the best players i ever played with obviously his iq was out of this world i was very lucky to get to team up with him do always talked about if he ever teamed up with me he knew we could win a championship and we did that lebron james james would undoubtedly vouch for rondo to join the lakers coaching staff no 23 has often stated his affinity towards guys with a high basketball iq according to james rondo is one of the most brilliant basketball minds ever without a doubt the job of coaching james as either the head coach or assistant is extraordinarily challenging without a doubt james passiveaggressive nature can make a coachs job much harder than it needs to be without a doubt james has some blood on his hands for the way darvin hams tenure went down for some that will be enough to brand james with that coach killer moniker one of the most brutal insults you can give a professional athlete in light of this recent criticism james perhaps decided hed stay out of it altogether however it wouldnt be a stunner if james spoke privately to rondo about signing on to coach rich paul the agent of lebron james appeared to accidentally hint at james future with the lakers your changes have been saved email is sent

7 shakes hands with forward jayson tatum after a dunk during the slam dunk competition during nba all star saturday night at lucas oil stadium mandatory credit kyle teradausa today sports is jaylen browns controversy a sign of deeper issues within the team usa basketballs managing director grant hill has been caught in a wave of controversies since the olympics began it started with jaylen browns exclusion from the squad and then jayson tatum not receiving enough playing time during the olympic games even though hill said that he would consider brown in the 2028 olympic squad things have not cooled down yet team usa went to the olympics with a starstudded lineup which comprised 12 players toptier nba players yes they won the gold but it was not all sunshine and rainbows behind the scenes with that much talent not everyone got the minutes they wanted even the big names from the nba squads just look at jayson tatumhe ended up with multiple dnps as he sat out two whole games with no playing time and not everyone was happy with it in light of that veteran nba analyst brian windhorst advised grant hill to pick the young players going ahead to avoid all the drama the idea is to start developing the young players specifically for fiba competitions and to build a squad that is down to stick together through a few summers leading up to big events like the 2028 olympics i dont necessarily think its the worst idea in the world to take all young guys to the world cup like do what they do in soccer of the olympics and say we are gonna take all 23 and under windhorst mentioned on the espn podcast advertisement article continues below this ad because weteam usa are gonna start developing fiba players we are gonna say hey commit to playing in the summer in 2026 commit to playing the summer in 27 and you are not promised for 28 but lets see where it leads maybe there shouldnt be in spots 11 and 12 maybe there shouldnt be star players there maybe there should be fiba players nba players dont get me wrong but fiba players who have played for multiple summers in a row the media vet further added is jaylen browns controversy a ticking time bomb for team usa react reactions windhorst wants team usa to create a crew thats more in sync with international play after all its all about longterm growth and commitment not just banking on nba stars talking about nba stars though whats been brewing between grant hill and jaylen brown lets dive deep it was not that long ago that jaylen brown took a shot at team usa and nike letting everyone know he was not cool with team usa picking his celtics teammate derrick white as kawhi leonards replacement instead of him the current finals mvp tweeted nike this what we doing brown was probably implying it was nike that kept him off the team usa roster advertisement article continues below this ad in response hill said and so whatever theories that might be out there theyre just that but thats my responsibility and its tough its tough to have conversations tell people that theyre not on the team jaylen brown did not take too kindly to being called a conspiracy theorist by the usab managing director as he shot back stating grant hill calling me a conspiracy theorist is disappointing ive been a vp of the nbpa since i was 21 years old i have a great understanding however grant hill now wants to squash the beef he is even open to having brown on the team usa squad in the 2028 olympics its a lot of noise im confident he and i will sit down at some point and talk about it and get to some level of understanding hell be a candidate if he wants in 2028 one thing ive learned you cant take anything personally in this role i havent personalized anything my objective my goal is to win and as soon as hopefully that happens we pivot and start looking ahead to the future hill said as this might have been the last season for many of the veteran players in the olympics there will probably be space for jaylen brown on the team usa roster for the 2028 olympics but the question is after all that has happened will brown accept the offer to be a part of team usa what are your thoughts advertisement

Jayson Tatum,"Will Jayson Tatum Lead the Charge in 2028 Olympics? Steve Kerr Decision Could Make Team USA a Boston Celtics Powerhouse, Here's How",https://www.essentiallysports.com/nba-active-basketball-news-will-jayson-tatum-lead-the-charge-in-two-thousand-twenty-eight-olympics-steve-kerr-decision-could-make-team-usa-a-boston-celtics-powerhouse-here-s-how/,more sports es fancast aug 11 2024 757 pm edt can jayson tatum turn team usa into a celticsdominated powerhouse in the 2028 olympics the announcement of the 2024 olympics roster drew criticism from many with the kind of talent available in the nba and the no of players willing to play disagreements were more than bound to happen but soon another controversy pretty much rocked the olympic boat steve kerr deciding not to play jayson tatum in the tournament opener really ruffled serious feathers but then again taking a look at the whole team usa campaign kerr has been at the receiving end of the short stick for his player combinations come 2028 when the next round of the olympics rolls up it seems like the usa basketball board could very well turn into a celtics powerhouse for one choosing derrick white over 2024 finals mvp jaylen brown after kawhi leonard withdrew his candidature had put managing director grant hill in the spotlightand not the good kind at the time hill calmed the crowd with a promise if brown was willing hed have a place in the 2028 olympic roster and for all the tatum fans this new evan sidery update on x would also prove to be quite a relief steve kerr is likely to retire as team usa head coach which means a new lead voice for 2028 in los angeles erik spoelstra is viewed as the strong internal favorite to become team usas next in line following gregg popovich and kerr advertisement article continues below this ad along with kerr lebron james kevin durant and stephen curry the threeheaded hydra of team usa are also likely to be retiring while its true that its a tough position to fill its still vacant and by 2028 theres no doubt that jt jb and white would very well adorn the veteran badge and if the 30yearold is still a celtic team usa would in effect be a celtics powerhouse poll 1 of 4 do you think jayson tatum can lead team usa to olympic gold in 2028 absolutely no way maybe if he gets more support only if steve kerr coaches have an interesting take join debate do you think adidas should have honored noah lyles instead of anthony edwards yes no both deserve recognition neither have an interesting take join debate who do you think had the biggest influence on nick meads rowing career his father his mother his siblings his coaches have an interesting take join debate what do you think about devin booker being spotted at noah lyles event supportive teammate just a fan publicity stunt coincidence have an interesting take join debate steve kerr is likely to retire as team usa head coach which means a new lead voice for 2028 in los angeles erik spoelstra is viewed as the strong internal favorite to become team usas next in line following gregg popovich and kerr pictwittercomnjym4i8cfx evan sidery esidery august 11 2024 expand tweet among those who demanded a proper explanation from steve kerr included jayson tatums mom brandy cole and the cs owner wyc grousbeck and they went public with their criticism the head coach however has played it diplomatic across the board and he delivered on the promise of bringing the gold medal back home even though the critics couldnt say much after that as even jayson was seen sharing a broad smile with his teammates lets dive deeper and see what his mother and franchise owner had to say earlier it was only a matter of time before brandy cole would be forced to put her foot down her son just led his team to an nba title in the wake of the best record in the league he earned a spot on the allnba first team for 3 years straight and received allstar recognition for 5 years so yes mama tatum was indignant and she made sure to let kerr know of it when she replied to a tweet from espns dick vitale someone pls let me know is jaytatum0 injured as he hasnt received the pt playing time u would expect an all nba player to get vitale posted from his x account cole immediately took the chance to retweet with a dig of her own no he not but if you find out whats going on please let me know unacceptable and makes no sense if kerr thought jts mom was the only one who had some words for him think again advertisement article continues below this ad kerrs actions also stupefied bostons majority owner grousbeck appearing on the greg hill show recently he said i mean i wouldnt play steve kerr let me put it that way its a complete mystery i think jayson doesnt deserve anything but praise kudos and playing time i think he and jaylen brown led us to this unbelievable championship and theyre not apparently helping the olympic team its mystifying clearly there are a lot of people who are unhappy with steve kerr but even amid such disappointing circumstances jayson tatum has his fill of happiness the nba championship obviously but the tatum family welcomed another member after the team usa win the 2x olympian and his family posed for family portraits and who else to join them but grammy winningsinger and tatums baby mama ella mai anyway the 2028 team usa roster is going to be very interesting if not for anything else to see if grant hill makes good on his word what do you think advertisement article continues below this ad before you go do not forget to

sports es fancast apr 21 2024 1022 pm edt via imago image credits imago via imago image credits imago it took stephen curry a few years to change basketball for good and for it he needed klay thompson and a welloiled machine that is the warriors caitlin clark is changing the landscape of womens basketball like no one before her but unlike steph the 22yearold is not bringing a revolution in how the game is played wnbas latest 1 pick is rather redefining the financial heights for a female basketball player sports apparel juggernauts nike with a reported 8year 28 million deal as per wsj made clark the biggest endorsement holder in womens basketball to put that in perspective lebron james the face of the nba struck a 90 million deal in 2003 the same year serena williams took home 40 million paving the way for female athletes around the globe it took a basketball player 21 years to reach anywhere near that number and clark still fell doubledigit short of those numbers but it is still a historic win for womens basketball how you ask lets deep dive right into it only 7 nba players have signed a bigger rookie shoe endorsement deal than caitlin clark advertisement article continues

millionyear that raises a question how much will the exiowa star make in wnba advertisement article continues below this ad this is where the disparity still makes the nba a different ball game altogether clark will make a mere 76535 in her rookie year as a 1 pick in the wnba in an overall 4year deal worth 338k spotrac claimed that her salary will increase year by year and she will take home 97582 in the fourth year soon after she was drafted the wnbas commissioner cathy engelbert revealed caitlin has the ability to make up to a half of a million dollars just in wnba wages this year so theyre just looking at a base which is collectively bargained and what is reported is actually is low because shes the no 1 pick advertisement article continues below this ad on the other hand in nba victor wembanyama and several other rookies before him made more than 10 million in their 1st year notably the wnba current players receive a revised salary after 2020 which is set under the current union collective bargaining agreement however there is a lot of catching up to do but with caitlins global recognition good paydays are not too far for female athletes and the wnba already got a

lead the show in a direction but shaq charles kenny what i mean hes johnson just throwing lobs and theyre finishing them further reggie miller said that the show provides honest feedback to the fans

DeMar DeRozan,DeMar DeRozan made himself a Chicago Bulls legend,https://www.chicagotribune.com/2024/07/08/chicago-bulls-demar-derozan-aura/,enewspaper sign up for email newsletters sign up for email newsletters enewspaper trending the king of the fourth became an actual king last weekend after chicago bulls star demar derozan went to sacramento in a signandtradethe kings get the best clutch player in the nba a clubhouse leader and a future hall of famer the bulls get two secondround picks and reserve guard chris duarte while increasing their chances of tanking and securing the top10 pick next year that otherwise goes to the san antonio spursfrom the outside it looks like another bad move for the bulls on top of the one that sent alex caruso to oklahoma city for josh giddey the team is getting progressively worse as the offseason continues a trend that figures to continue when or if they deal zach lavine their only remaining player who has appeared in an allstar game the past three yearsfrom the inside im sure executive vice president of basketball operations artras karniovas is patting himself on the back for kickstarting a rebuild thats certain to buy him more time with chairman jerry reinsdorfkarniovas telegraphed his intentions at the end of the season and now is carrying through with his plan his last plan didnt work so well the bulls have a 491 winning percentage in his four years at the helm and only one playoff appearancekarniovas knew the bulls core would eventually be broken up but did nothing at the 24 trade deadline now hes actually breaking it up and getting next to nothing in returnin reinsdorfs mind that counts as progress remember he let rick hahn execute a rebuild after four failed seasons as the white sox general manager and watched him win two postseason games in the next six seasons before firing him last summerits mindblowing to be a chicago sports fan and see the same things happen over and over chicago bulls forward demar derozan center interrupts a postgame interview with guard coby white on feb 6 2024 at the united center vincent albanchicago tribunewhen derozan arrived in chicago three summers ago i admittedly was not overwhelmed he hadnt made an allstar team since 201718 and it seemed as though his best years were in the past he basically disappeared in san antonio following a stellar career in torontobut derozan soon proved he was far from finished leading the bulls to the top of the eastern conference at the outset of his first season they had a 2711 record and were atop the east on jan 11 2022 and derozan had come up big so often that he earned his king of the fourth monikerbut the bulls season fell apart with the loss of lonzo ball two games later and they never recovered karniovas didnt get derozan or lavine any scoring help the next two offseasons and both seasons resulted in losses in the playin roundso the derozan era ended with a thud only one playoff appearance the 41 firstround loss to the milwaukee bucks in 22none of this was his fault mind you derozan continued to defy age and played almost every game in the era of load management where veterans tend to sit out the second game of backtobacks every opportunity they gethow many times does a 34yearold lead the league in total minutes or minutes per game as derozan did last year ill hang up and listen for the answerlove and losses how demar derozan defined the chicago bulls during his 3year tenurederozan said all along he loved chicago and wanted to return but assuredly he knew the bulls werent interested especially after the caruso deal before the draft derozan turns 35 next month so perhaps it made perfect basketball sense for karniovas not to bring him back the threeyear 74 million deal with the kings carries some risks at his agebut derozan will now be a part of a new big three in sacramento with deaaron fox and domantas sabonis and will have a better chance at finally winning a ring than he wouldve had in chicagowhether he can help make the kings into a true contender in the west is debatable with the emergence of the young guns in minnesota and oklahoma city and a denver team that now has something to prove after being knocked out of the playoffs by the timberwolves in a game 7 loss on their home courteither way sacramento fans are already excited about the acquisition derozan received a big ovation when he and kings owner vivek ranadiv walked through the tunnel together at the golden 1 center on saturday for the kings california summer league game it was a kings welcome if there ever was oneit was heartening to see and a reminder of how much derozan was loved and respected in chicago he wasnt just another basketball player for the bulls but the heartbeat of the franchise one of the best teammates you could ask for and always available and accountable to the media no matter how tough a lossayo dosunmu coby white and patrick williams all owe him a debt of gratitude for teaching them how to be professionals hopefully those lessons will endurethe bulls might be able to replace his scoring but its a stretch to believe they can replace derozans presence in the locker room maybe that doesnt matter to karniovas if they keep getting younger and dont intend on contending for a few years but it shouldrelated articles chicago bulls heres the schedule and pairings for this years nba cup including when the chicago bulls will play chicago bulls lonzo ball is on track with a return to scrimmaging but josh giddey remains the chicago bulls shortterm and maybe longterm solution chicago bulls what can chicago bulls fans take away from josh giddeys performance for australia at the olympics chicago bulls warner bros discovery the parent company of tnt sports sues nba for not accepting offer in mediarights deal chicago bulls nba signs 11year mediarights deal with disney nbc and amazon ending its ties with tnt after next season assuming karniovas finds a new location for lavine the 202425 bulls will be whites chance to be the star of the show he was one of the finalists for most improved player last year and seemed to have elevated his game for keeps after a career marked by streakinessif firstround pick matas buzelis lives up to his draftday hype and giddey emerges with a bigger offensive role than he was afforded in oklahoma city it should at least be a team thats fun to watch on a nightly basisnikola vuevi could even remain in the middle and continue to serve as a doubledouble threat with newly signed center jalen smith providing more scoring off the bench than they got from andre drummondkarniovas isnt done yet so maybe he has something up his sleeve that will crank up the optimism from bulls nation if not its just going to put more pressure on caleb williams to bring chicago a winner with the bearson the bright side at least the bulls have a head start on the derozan tribute video for next season when the kings come to townhomecomings for former chicago heroes are what we do best the kings get the best clutch player in the nba a clubhouse leader and a future hall of famer the bulls get two secondround picks and reserve guard chris

losses in the playin round so the derozan era ended with a thud only one playoff appearance the 41 firstround loss to the milwaukee bucks in 22 none of this was his fault mind you derozan continued to defy age and played almost every game in the era of load management where veterans tend to sit out the second game of backtobacks every opportunity they get how many times does a 34yearold lead the league in total minutes or minutes per game as derozan did last year ill hang up and listen for the answer love and losses how demar derozan defined the chicago bulls during his 3year tenure derozan said all along he loved chicago and wanted to return but assuredly he knew the bulls werent interested especially after the caruso deal before the draft derozan turns 35 next month so perhaps it made perfect basketball sense for karniovas not to bring him back the threeyear 74 million deal with the kings carries some risks at his age but derozan will now be a part of a new big three in sacramento with deaaron fox and domantas sabonis and will have a better chance at finally winning a ring than he wouldve had in chicago whether he can help make the kings into a true contender in the west is debatable with the emergence of the young guns in minnesota and oklahoma city and a denver team that now has something to prove after being knocked out of the playoffs by the timberwolves in a game 7 loss on their home court either way sacramento fans are already excited about the acquisition derozan received a big ovation when he and kings owner vivek ranadiv walked through the tunnel together at the golden 1 center on saturday for the kings california summer league game it was a kings welcome if there ever was one it was heartening to see and a reminder of how much derozan was loved and respected in chicago he wasnt just another basketball player for the bulls but the heartbeat of the franchise one of the best teammates you could ask for and always available and accountable to the media no matter how tough a loss ayo dosunmu coby white and patrick williams all owe him a debt of gratitude for teaching them how to be professionals hopefully those lessons will endure the bulls might be able to replace his scoring but its a stretch to believe they can replace derozans presence in the locker room maybe that doesnt matter to karniovas if they keep getting younger and dont intend on contending for a few years but it should assuming karniovas finds a new location for lavine the 202425 bulls will be whites chance to be the star of the show he was one of the finalists for most improved player last year and seemed to have elevated his game for keeps after a career marked by streakiness if firstround pick matas buzelis lives up to his draftday hype and giddey emerges with a bigger offensive role than he was afforded in oklahoma city it should at least be a team thats fun to watch on a nightly basis nikola vuevi could even remain in the middle and continue to serve as a doubledouble threat with newly signed center jalen smith providing more scoring off the bench than they got from andre drummond karniovas isnt done yet so maybe he has something up his sleeve that will crank up the optimism from bulls nation if not its just going to put more pressure on caleb williams to bring chicago a winner with the bears on the bright side at least the bulls have a head start on the derozan tribute video for next season when the kings come to town homecomings for former chicago heroes are what we do best copyright 2024 chicago

DeMar DeRozan,How DeMar DeRozan defined Chicago Bulls during his 3-year tenure,https://www.chicagotribune.com/2024/07/07/demar-derozan-chicago-bulls-love/,enewspaper sign up for email newsletters sign up for email newsletters enewspaper trending when demar derozan talked about the chicago bulls he often talked about loveit wasnt always outright but beneath the jokes the analysis and even the frustration that affection was the most consistent undercurrent of derozans conversations the trust he built with his teammates the refusal to let a few hard weeks or months or years shake his belief that he could make something happen hereeven as resigning conversations stalled out in the final stretch of last season derozan joked that negotiating with the team was like reasoning with a spouse after a fight what do we need to do to work on this baby lets figure this thing out you want me i want youthe love never fully ran out that was clear on the court where derozan was always undeniably recklessly invested he played hurt he played tired hell he probably played too much last season derozan led the nba in playing time at the age of 34 in his threeyear stint in chicago he played more than 90 of possible gamesit wasnt enough of course not no amount of buzzerbeater heaves and 30point games could outweigh the dysfunction and disrepair of the bulls roster construction the past three years but for three years derozan lifted the bulls to be more than they were meant to bein chicago derozan got back to being himselfhe had already rebuilt his game in san antonio but it took signing in chicago to truly reestablish himself in the nba over three seasons derozan averaged 255 points while shooting 496 from the field in the process he earned backtoback allstar selections notched 12 games with 40 or more points and cemented his moniker of king in the fourth as a twotime clutch player of the year runnerupthere was a moment when it seemed like all of this was going to work out here derozans first winter in chicago was filled with hope despite all the offseason criticism derozan was clicking alongside zach lavine lonzo ball and nikola vuevi and there was nothing derozan loved more than proving doubters wrongand then 2022 came on dec 31 2021 derozan launched off one leg as the clock ran down in indianapolis slinging a 3pointer to close the year with a win over the pacers the next night derozan repeated the feat tossing in his signature pump fake before landing a dagger three from the corner in washington dc to beat the wizardsno player had ever made buzzerbeater gamewinners from behind the arc on consecutive nights it was another slice of history for derozan another highlight that belied the weaknesses that would soon send the bulls tumbling from their stature atop the eastern conferencethe impossibility of that shot in indiana one leg up the shot clock forgotten captured everything that worked about derozan with the bulls but its the image that came after that that fully crystallized the hopefulness of the moment derozan with his fists in the air teammates hanging off his shoulders and dragging him to the ground the clock run down to zero with the bulls ahead by twodarron cummingsapbulls demar derozan celebrates with coby white after derozan hit the gamewinning shot against the indiana pacers dec 31 2021 in indianapolis darron cummingsapafter coby white missed his own potential gamewinning buzzerbeater in february derozan didnt hesitate to teach he instructed a trainer to grab a laptop and pull up the film of the final play with his jersey still on and ice halfwrapped to his hip and knee derozan stood barefoot in the center of the locker room leaning over whites shoulder as they clicked frame by frame through the playit could be better derozan encouraged white it would be better but draw up 100 versions of the same play and derozan would put the ball in whites hands every timethis is the aspect of derozan that the bulls will struggle the most to replicate they can find another leading scorer and put the ball in another set of hands in the fourth quarter but derozan was the heart and the rudder of this team for

accepting offer in mediarights deal chicago bulls nba signs 11year mediarights deal with disney nbc and amazon ending its ties with tnt after next season these are the traces that derozan will leave on this young roster the confidence he imbued into white as a leader the persistence he honed for rookies like dalen terry on the court derozan was best known for his deadly midrange jumpers and fourthquarter heroism but within the locker room derozan made a name for himself with his bulls teammates by just showing uphe drove hours to champaign to see ayo dosunmus jersey retired by illinois

something you can decide to be you have to have it within yourself demar has earned our respect with the way hes played with his achievements the way he comports himself on the court off the court he really took the time to make sure he knew everybody and established himself as somebody we could trustthree days into 2022 derozan couldnt go homeit was an off night the bulls had beaten the orlando

didnt care to repeatso he stayed united center workers began to strip the opposing stanchion break down the sideline seating and peel up the court to reveal the ice concealed under the hardwood for an upcoming blackhawks game and derozan stayed until he made 250 shots from the stripe until he made things rightderozan never had the chance to make things right in chicago his departure to the sacramento kings reflected a harsher truth there probably never was a chance the bulls were too broken the roster too flawed it was never going to work outbut the love was there that was never in doubt and as the bulls take their next steps the impact of derozans devotion to his team will remain on the court and in the locker room and within this young generation he shaped it wasnt always outright but beneath the jokes the analysis and even the frustration that affection was the most consistent undercurrent of derozans conversations the trust he built with his teammates the refusal to let a few hard weeks or months or years shake his belief that he could make something happen here even as resigning conversations stalled out in the final stretch of last season derozan joked that negotiating with the team was like reasoning with a spouse after a fight what do we need to do to work on this baby lets figure this thing out you want me i want you the love never fully ran out that was clear on the court where derozan was always undeniably recklessly invested he played hurt he played tired hell he probably played too much last season derozan led the nba in playing time at the age of 34 in his threeyear stint in chicago he played more than 90 of possible games it wasnt enough of course not no amount of buzzerbeater heaves and 30point games could outweigh the dysfunction and disrepair of the bulls roster construction the past three years but for three years derozan lifted the bulls to be more than they were meant to be in chicago derozan got back to being himself he had already rebuilt his game in san antonio but it took signing in chicago to truly reestablish himself in the nba over three seasons derozan averaged 255 points while shooting 496 from the field in the process he earned backtoback allstar selections notched 12 games with 40 or more points and cemented his moniker of king in the fourth as a twotime clutch player of the year runnerup there was a moment when it seemed like all of this was going to work out here derozans first winter in chicago was filled with hope despite all the offseason criticism derozan was clicking alongside zach lavine lonzo ball and nikola vuevi and there was nothing derozan loved more than proving doubters wrong and then 2022 came on dec 31 2021 derozan launched off one leg as the clock ran down in indianapolis slinging a 3pointer to close the year with a win over the pacers the next night derozan repeated the feat tossing in his signature pump fake before landing a dagger three from the corner in washington dc to beat the wizards no player had ever made buzzerbeater gamewinners from behind the arc on consecutive nights it was another slice of history for derozan another highlight that belied the weaknesses that would soon send the bulls tumbling from their stature atop the eastern conference the impossibility of that shot in indiana one leg up the shot clock forgotten captured everything that worked about derozan with the bulls but its the image that came after that that fully crystallized the hopefulness of the moment derozan with his fists in the air teammates hanging off his shoulders and dragging him to the ground the clock run down to zero with the bulls ahead by two after coby white missed his own potential gamewinning buzzerbeater in february derozan didnt hesitate to teach he instructed a trainer to grab a laptop and pull up the film of the final play with his jersey still on and ice halfwrapped to his hip and knee derozan stood barefoot in the center of the locker room leaning over whites shoulder as they clicked frame by frame through the play it could be better derozan encouraged white it would be better but draw up 100 versions of the same play and derozan would put the ball in whites hands every time this is the aspect of derozan that the bulls will struggle the most to replicate they can find another leading scorer and put the ball in another set of hands in the fourth quarter but derozan was the heart and the rudder of this team for three years the hardest part of a team getting younger is the loss of experienced gravitas derozan wasnt a huge talker but he didnt need to say much he set a standard through action this was a shared trait with alex caruso whose departure to oklahoma city will similarly gut the locker room of a muchneeded veteran

browns controversy a sign of deeper issues within the team usa basketballs managing director grant hill has been caught in a wave of controversies since the olympics began it started with jaylen browns exclusion from the squad and then jayson tatum not receiving enough playing time during the olympic games even though hill said that he would consider brown in the 2028 olympic squad things have not cooled down yet team usa went to the olympics with a starstudded lineup which comprised 12 players toptier nba players yes they won the gold but it was not all sunshine and rainbows behind the scenes with that much talent not everyone got the minutes they wanted even the big names from the nba squads just look at jayson tatumhe ended up with multiple dnps as he sat out two whole games with no playing time and not everyone was happy with it in light of that veteran nba analyst brian windhorst advised grant hill to pick the young players going ahead to avoid all the drama the idea is to start developing the young players specifically for fiba competitions and to build a squad that is down to stick together through a few summers leading up to big events like the 2028 olympics i dont necessarily think its the worst idea in the world to take all young guys to the world cup like do what they do in soccer of the olympics and say we are gonna take all 23 and under windhorst mentioned on the espn podcast advertisement article continues below this ad because weteam usa are gonna start developing fiba players we are gonna say hey commit to playing in the summer in 2026 commit to playing the summer in 27 and you are not promised for 28 but lets see where it leads maybe there shouldnt be in spots 11 and 12 maybe there shouldnt be star players there maybe there should be fiba players nba players dont get me wrong but fiba players who have played for multiple summers in a row the media vet further added is jaylen browns controversy a ticking time bomb for team usa react reactions windhorst wants team usa to create a crew thats more in sync with international play after all its all about longterm growth and commitment not just banking on nba stars talking about nba stars though whats been brewing between grant hill and jaylen brown lets dive deep it was not that long ago that jaylen brown took a shot at team usa and nike letting everyone know he was not cool with team usa picking his celtics teammate derrick white as kawhi leonards replacement instead of him the current finals mvp tweeted nike this what we doing brown was probably implying it was nike that kept him off the team usa roster advertisement article continues below this ad in response hill said and so whatever theories that might be out there theyre just that but thats my responsibility and its tough its tough to have conversations tell people that theyre not on the team jaylen brown did not take too kindly to being called a conspiracy theorist by the usab managing director as he shot back stating grant hill calling me a conspiracy theorist is disappointing ive been a vp of the nbpa since i was 21 years old i have a great understanding however grant hill now wants to squash the beef he is even open to having brown on the team usa squad in the 2028 olympics its a lot of noise im confident he and i will sit down at some point and talk about it and get to some level of understanding hell be a candidate if he wants in 2028 one thing ive learned you cant take anything personally in this role i havent personalized anything my objective my goal is to win and as soon as hopefully that happens we pivot and start looking ahead to the future hill said as this might have been the last season for many of the veteran players in the olympics there will probably be space for

7 shakes hands with forward jayson tatum after a dunk during the slam dunk competition during nba all star saturday night at lucas oil stadium mandatory credit kyle teradausa today sports is jaylen browns controversy a sign of deeper issues within the team usa basketballs managing director grant hill has been caught in a wave of controversies since the olympics began it started with jaylen browns exclusion from the squad and then jayson tatum not receiving enough playing time during the olympic games even though hill said that he would consider brown in the 2028 olympic squad things have not cooled down yet team usa went to the olympics with a starstudded lineup which comprised 12 players toptier nba players yes they won the gold but it was not all sunshine and rainbows behind the scenes with that much talent not everyone got the minutes they wanted even the big names from the nba squads just look at jayson tatumhe ended up with multiple dnps as he sat out two whole games with no playing time and not everyone was happy with it in light of that veteran nba analyst brian windhorst advised grant hill to pick the young players going ahead to avoid all the drama the idea is to start developing the young players specifically for fiba competitions and to build a squad that is down to stick together through a few summers leading up to big events like the 2028 olympics i dont necessarily think its the worst idea in the world to take all young guys to the world cup like do what they do in soccer of the olympics and say we are gonna take all 23 and under windhorst mentioned on the espn podcast advertisement article continues below this ad because weteam usa are gonna start developing fiba players we are gonna say hey commit to playing in the summer in 2026 commit to playing the summer in 27 and you are not promised for 28 but lets see where it leads maybe there shouldnt be in spots 11 and 12 maybe there shouldnt be star players there maybe there should be fiba players nba players dont get me wrong but fiba players who have played for multiple summers in a row the media vet further added is jaylen browns controversy a ticking time bomb for team usa react reactions windhorst wants team usa to create a crew thats more in sync with international play after all its all about longterm growth and commitment not just banking on nba stars talking about nba stars though whats been brewing between grant hill and jaylen brown lets dive deep it was not that long ago that jaylen brown took a shot at team usa and nike letting everyone know he was not cool with team usa picking his celtics teammate derrick white as kawhi leonards replacement instead of him the current finals mvp tweeted nike this what we doing brown was probably implying it was nike that kept him off the team usa roster advertisement article continues below this ad in response hill said and so whatever theories that might be out there theyre just that but thats my responsibility and its tough its tough to have conversations tell people that theyre not on the team jaylen brown did not take too kindly to being called a conspiracy theorist by the usab managing director as he shot back stating grant hill calling me a conspiracy theorist is disappointing ive been a vp of the nbpa since i was 21 years old i have a great understanding however grant hill now wants to squash the beef he is even open to having brown on the team usa squad in the 2028 olympics its a lot of noise im confident he and i will sit down at some point and talk about it and get to some level of understanding hell be a candidate if he wants in 2028 one thing ive learned you cant take anything personally in this role i havent personalized anything my objective my goal is to win and as soon as hopefully that happens we pivot and start looking ahead to the future hill said as this might have been the last season for many of the veteran players in the olympics there will probably be space for jaylen brown on the team usa roster for the 2028 olympics but the question is after all that has happened will brown accept the offer to be a part of team usa what are your thoughts advertisement

nikewhos in the wrong here share your thoughts from appearance alone there are no reservations when looking at the adorned team usa olympic team packed with the best of the league youngsters and veterans there is no weakness however a major point of discussion was the exclusion of jaylen brown as the reigning finals mvp brown felt sour about being excluded even blaming nike but with three other celtics teammates on the roster did the organization make an effort to push his case recently celtics president brad stevens spoke to the boston globe about the entire situation having seen browns dexterity for years stevens had no doubt over his capabilities but at the same time the former head coach of the celtics isnt one to meddle in the process although he did put in a good word i just tell everybody how great our guys are and then i stay out of it i think thats my role i think jaylen could be on any olympic team any given year he could be a featured part of those teams i saw usa basketball director grant hill said hed love to sit down and talk to him about being part of that pool in 28 whatever that may be stevens told the boston globe advertisement article continues

sports poll 1 of 4 do you think brad stevens should intervene in jaylen browns feud with nike yes its his responsibility no its a personal matter only if it affects the team not sure have an interesting take join debate do you think lebron james dream of owning an nba team in las vegas will come true absolutely no way maybe but not soon only if he partners with someone have an interesting take join debate do you think frances victor wembanyama can derail team usas gold medal dreams absolutely no way maybe but its unlikely only if team usa underperforms have an interesting take join debate do you agree with steve kerrs decision to bench jayson tatum absolutely not at all depends on the situation im not sure have an interesting take join debate it was during all the smokes open run that hill told rachel nichols that he would be open to welcoming jaylen brown on the 2028 olympics team when the competition will take place in los angeles additionally grant also previously revealed his having a conversation with browns agent and explaining it was really truly a basketball decision jaylen brown though seems unconvinced and has proclaimed to speak more indepth about his exclusion at a later time while it isnt a pleasant situation stevens feels the 27yearold will return with a vengeance even before the paris olympics saga jaylen brown was among the best combo guards in the entire league his fervor during the postseason showed flashes of his true potential as he improved as a defender and became the focal attack point his diligent efforts were rewarded with mvps in both the ecf and the nba finals advertisement article continues below this ad but is there another level to his basketball gifts stevens feels the olympics snub will motivate jaylen brown to evolve his game a step further but i think jaylen is one of the best players in the world and one of the best things about jaylen is whether he gets the call and makes the team or doesnt get the call hes going to use it as motivation to get better so i know hes working and hes excited about improving i think hell truly embrace the challenges that come with winning last year thats who hes always been and this will probably add more fuel to his fire but he doesnt need much fuel added he finds it stevens said the nba landscape has changed drastically in the months since the celtics claimed their 18th title teams such as the new york knicks and philadelphia 76ers have made major trades in the offseason similar to the west the east is no longer a onesided conference the celtics will face much severe competition not only due to the improved teams but also their status as the current champions advertisement article continues below this ad and its never easy to repeat at the same time the celtics are looking to begin a dynasty spearheaded by jaylen brown and jayson tatum with the sweet taste of victory the prolific duo is not one to let the competition steal whats theirs nor are the

Jaylen Brown,USA Basketball: Grant Hill says Jaylen Brown will be considered for 2028 Olympics after omission in Paris,https://www.cbssports.com/olympics/news/usa-basketball-grant-hill-says-jaylen-brown-will-be-considered-for-2028-olympics-after-omission-in-paris/,if not listed please contact your tv provider usa basketball director grant hill hopes to clear the air with boston celtics forward jaylen brown brown took issue with not being selected as a replacement on the 2024 paris olympics roster after kawhi leonard withdrew from the team team usa elected to choose browns celtics teammate derrick white for the open roster spot leading to brown calling out usa basketball and nike the official apparel brand for team usa brown implied on social media that nike was the reason he was kept off the team to which hill responded at the time saying in part whatever theories that might be out there theyre just that but thats my responsibility and its tough its tough to have conversations tell people that theyre not on the team brown then shot back on social media calling out hill saying grant hill calling me a conspiracy theorist is disappointing ive been a vp of the nbpa since i was 21 years old i have a great understanding while the dust had settled on the situation since the olympics started hill said on the open run podcast with rachel nichols that he hopes to talk with brown and that he will be considered for the 2028 los angeles olympics when you have a team with the profile of players on this team you know theres going to be controversy you know that coming in i knew that i think what people fail to realize is im a fan of basketball and im a fan of these guys that are playing in the current eramy whole approach is to celebrate the greatness of todays players so yeah it was disappointing you gotta do your job ive tried to do this the right way when we first put out the roster back in april before it was announced i called certain guys i called paul george damian lillard jaylen brown i felt like they were of a certain stature where they deserved to hear it before it was made public and i appreciated their willingness to want to be a part of this but also wanted them to appreciate just how difficult this was to me that was leading with integrity doing the right thing recognizing who they are what theyve meant to usa basketball in years past its a lot of noise im confident he and i will sit down at some point and talk about it and get to some level of understanding hell be a candidate if he wants in 2028 one thing ive learned you cant take anything personal in this role i havent personalized anything my objective my goal is to win and as soon as hopefully that happen we pivot and start looking ahead to the future brown certainly has the resume to make the usa basketball roster especially after this season during which he finished as an nba champion and finals mvp while leading the celtics throughout the postseason to their first title since 2008 but making the roster for usa basketball is the most difficult team to make given all the talent you could argue that he shouldve been named the replacement over white but there were very good reasons to have white on the roster over brown too while team usa looks on pace to earn its fifth straight gold medal the 2028 olympics will be a total change of guard for the mens basketball team lebron james could be retired and kevin durant and stephen curry will be 39 and 40 years old respectively so naturally there will be more room for brown to be on the roster hill sounds more than ready to bury the hatchet well just have to see if brown is willing to do the same 20042024 cbs interactive all

Jaylen Brown,USA Basketball: Grant Hill says Jaylen Brown will be considered for 2028 Olympics after omission in Paris,https://www.cbssports.com/olympics/news/usa-basketball-grant-hill-says-jaylen-brown-will-be-considered-for-2028-olympics-after-omission-in-paris/,if not listed please contact your tv provider usa basketball director grant hill hopes to clear the air with boston celtics forward jaylen brown brown took issue with not being selected as a replacement on the 2024 paris olympics roster after kawhi leonard withdrew from the team team usa elected to choose browns celtics teammate derrick white for the open roster spot leading to brown calling out usa basketball and nike the official apparel brand for team usa brown implied on social media that nike was the reason he was kept off the team to which hill responded at the time saying in part whatever theories that might be out there theyre just that but thats my responsibility and its tough its tough to have conversations tell people that theyre not on the team brown then shot back on social media calling out hill saying grant hill calling me a conspiracy theorist is disappointing ive been a vp of the nbpa since i was 21 years old i have a great understanding while the dust had settled on the situation since the olympics started hill said on the open run podcast with rachel nichols that he hopes to talk with brown and that he will be considered for the 2028 los angeles olympics when you have a team with the profile of players on this team you know theres going to be controversy you know that coming in i knew that i think what people fail to realize is im a fan of basketball and im a fan of these guys that are playing in the current eramy whole approach is to celebrate the greatness of todays players so yeah it was disappointing you gotta do your job ive tried to do this the right way when we first put out the roster back in april before it was announced i called certain guys i called paul george damian lillard jaylen brown i felt like they were of a certain stature where they deserved to hear it before it was made public and i appreciated their willingness to want to be a part of this but also wanted them to appreciate just how difficult this was to me that was leading with integrity doing the right thing recognizing who they are what theyve meant to usa basketball in years past its a lot of noise im confident he and i will sit down at some point and talk about it and get to some level of understanding hell be a candidate if he wants in 2028 one thing ive learned you cant take anything personal in this role i havent personalized anything my objective my goal is to win and as soon as hopefully that happen we pivot and start looking ahead to the future brown certainly has the resume to make the usa basketball roster especially after this season during which he finished as an nba champion and finals mvp while leading the celtics throughout the postseason to their first title since 2008 but making the roster for usa basketball is the most difficult team to make given all the talent you could argue that he shouldve been named the replacement over white but there were very good reasons to have white on the roster over brown too while team usa looks on pace to earn its fifth straight gold medal the 2028 olympics will be a total change of guard for the mens basketball team lebron james could be retired and kevin durant and stephen curry will be 39 and 40 years old respectively so naturally there will be more room for brown to be on the roster hill sounds more than ready to bury the hatchet well just have to see if brown is willing to do the same 20042024 cbs interactive all

LaMarcus Aldridge,LaMarcus Aldridge retires as one of his generation's unluckiest and most underappreciated NBA superstars,https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/lamarcus-aldridge-retires-as-one-of-his-generations-unluckiest-and-most-underappreciated-nba-superstars/,if not listed please contact your tv provider an undercurrent of disrespect permeated lamarcus aldridges 2015 free agency for a week that july he was the center of the nba universe the lone championshipaltering force on a market accustomed to players just a hair greater aldridge was never lebron james or kevin durant but for that one week he was treated like it and it was a feeling he seemingly wanted to replicate in perpetuity despite winning 105 games in his last two seasons in portland reports indicated that his desire to compete for championships was matched or perhaps exceeded by his longing for validation adrian wojnarowski even reported at the time that aldridge loathed driving around portland and seeing the many billboards adidas had posted featuring teammate damian lillard free agency was an opportunity to win but more importantly it was an opportunity to do so on his own terms its something aldridge who announced his retirement for the second time on friday never really got to do in 16 nba seasons he started his career as the third wheel to a preordained brandon roygreg oden dynasty and by the time injuries ruined it lillards ascent rendered him a sidekick on the only team hed ever known the egalitarian theory of the spurs offered an alternative that kawhi leonards brilliance swallowed in practice aldridge asked for a trade after his second season in san antonio and rescinded it only after leonards injury granted him the spotlight he so craved but never quite deserved the aldridgeled spurs were good they made the playoffs but without a leonardcaliber leading man aldridge was never going to win a championship it makes his career an interesting case study in compromise sidekicking is notoriously tedious stars routinely grumble about the sacrifices it takes to win alongside superior teammates but aldridge never got the chance he reached the conference finals only once and by the time he was willing to sacrifice enough of the trappings of stardom to reach the absolute highest levels of winning it was too late aldridge played only five games on the contending 202021 nets before a heart condition ended his season he played 47 more games for the nets in 202122 but the team fell way short of expectations it was the least satisfying possible outcome for aldridges career he never held the keys to a franchise as lillard does now nor did he have the chance to ride shotgun on the way to someone elses championship it was ultimately a case of poor luck on both fronts and it dates back to the very beginning of his career the toronto raptors held the no 1 overall pick in the 2006 nba draft and despite the pleas of fellow texan chris bosh opted for andrea bargnani as their top choice that robbed aldridge of an ideal longterm frontcourt partner a modern mismatch machine of a duo that would have drawn opposing bigs out of the paint a full decade before they were ready to one pick later the chicago bulls drafted him at no 2 and for a moment the chance to serve as michael jordans longawaited successor could have made aldridge one of the leagues brightest young stars that picks original owner offered similar marketability had they not traded for eddy curry aldridge may well have begun his career as the face of the new york knicks but big market fame eluded him after a trade to portland that should have earned him some jewelry injuries to oden and roy and then leonard in san antonio only scratch the surface of why it didnt the 201314 blazers started the season 319 before injuries to aldridge cost them a possible 60win season a year later portland trailed only the nascent warriors in the western conference standings when wes matthews tore his achilles and knocked the blazers out of championship contention neither was aldridges best team though that honor belongs to the historically overlooked 2016 spurs fun fact the 73win warriors of 2016 didnt have the nbas best point differential san antonios plus111 net rating outpaced golden states plus106 the spurs had the nbas no 4ranked offense and best overall defense but ran into a durantshaped buzzsaw in the second round of the postseason durants warriors knocked aldridge and the spurs out of the postseason again a year later when leonard landed on zaza pachulias foot in what would have been a game 1 rout just like that aldridges title hopes were dashed his loss ironically was the gain of one of his draftmates kyle lowry also had a brief window to contend with leonard but when that very raptors team that didnt draft aldridge ran into durant in 2019 the player that deprived aldridge of his title was injured lowry will forever be remembered as a champion based on that run and justifiably so but he benefited from circumstances that deprived aldridge of the same privilege by most traditional measures of individual successpoints allstar appearances allnba nods career earningshis career was superior it wont be remembered quite as fondly without that feather in his cap its no wonder aldridge was so imageconscious in 2015 portland couldnt give him a championship but it couldnt give him what it gave lillard either it makes legislating his legacy a somewhat complicated affair aldridge fits in no defined box and his career has no identifiable arc he was a constant never changing a midrange shooting style that carried him from evolutionary to anachronism across a changing league for over a decade he flirted with the traditional benchmark of big man stardomthe coveted 20 and 10 status symbol that has long since gone out of fashionyet between 2008 and 2018 his scoring never deviated by more than six points per game he just kept chugging along putting up allstar caliber numbers on teams only locals and league pass junkies ever watched it irked aldridge enough to take matters into his own hands he asked for trades in 2013 and 2017 and used free agency to change teams in 2015 always looking for something slightly different perhaps sensing the end was near he used a recent buyout to take one last swing at the championship that eluded him but in the grand scheme of his career it seems appropriate that he wont end up winning one not because he isnt deserving but because without one the discourse will have to meet him on his terms remembering lamarcus aldridge means reckoning with an often unsatisfying career but an enormously successful one regardless those unkind circumstances can enforce a somewhat more honest conversation about who aldridge was as a player there is no easy narrative no legendary team or mindboggling statistic to condense his contributions into he wont be on billboards now that his career is over he was just a great player whose talent was narrowly beaten out by his poor luck that luck robbed him of the attention his talent warranted during his career with some distance its praise he more than deserves in retirement 20042024 cbs interactive all rights reserved cbs sports is a registered trademark of cbs

thrivingdo you think theyll follow in his legendary footsteps scotty pippen jr often makes it to the headlines but the other kids of the exbulls star not so much many basketball enthusiasts would still know of pips 4 children with larsa however not much is reported about the other three children that the 6x nba champ had before them notably these three children come from three different exes of scottie pippen karen mccollum sonya roby and yvette deleone lets have a closer look at not just pips 7 children but also at what they have been up to and what kind of bond do they share with their father advertisement article continues below this ad the fans of the 7x allstar would know that long before larsa pippen was married to karen mccollum and it was with his first wife that he welcomed his firstborn antron into this world in december 1987 growing up in lawrenceville he played basketball for south georgia technical college and later for the world basketball association in 2013 if one is to believe scottie his son was a late bloomer but still better than him in high school poll 1 of 4 which of scottie pippens seven kids do you think will make the biggest impact in sports antron pippen scotty pippen jr preston pippen sierra pippen justin pippen sophia pippen taylor pippen have an interesting take join debate who do you think handled the anthony edwards and adidas controversy better anthony edwards adidas noah lyles usain bolt have an interesting take join debate do you think dennis rodman was a good father to alexis yes no its complicated not sure have an interesting take join debate which of devin bookers rumored relationships surprised you the most kendall jenner jordyn woods christina nadin hannah harrison have an interesting take join debate but before we could see more of antrons basketball talents on the big stage he passed away at 33 although pip never revealed the exact cause of death he shared in an ig post that his son suffered from chronic asthma he never let that get him down though antron stayed positive and worked hard and i am so proud of the man that he became read the post this was the 6x nba champs only child with his first wife a post shared by scottie pippen scottiepippen his second child came into this world in july 1994 with his exgirlfriend sonya roby the fact he did not want to accept the parental responsibility of his first daughter may surprise some fans as per the information by the associated press he accepted taylor pippen as his daughter only after a dna test disapproved of his denial following this scottie pippen agreed to provide financial support while roby retained the full custody of her daughter but it turns out his relationship with his eldest daughter remained limited to this arrangement itself i know that people expect a lot from me but after all these years i have learned that pippen is just that a last name taylor said in an interview but her development into an accomplished athlete proves that the apple doesnt fall from the tree no matter what not only did taylor play volleyball for southern illinois university but went pro in spain for one season in 2016 by 2024 she became the vice president of commercial banking at jp morgan chase co notably taylor also had a twin sister named tyler but she died soon after her birth at the hospital itself as for pips last child before marrying larsa he had yet again denied being the father after a paternity suit by his exgirlfriend yvette deleone the court revealed scottie to be the father of sierra pippen the exbulls star eventually reached a settlement where he agreed to cover all the educational and other expenses of his daughter born in february 1995 having attended the university of iowa sierra believes in keeping the rest of her personal life mostly to herself most hardcore fans of the 7x allstar would remember pip marrying larsa in july 1997 and welcoming his first son with her scotty pippen jr in november 2000 pippen jr has reached the highest level of basketball among any of his children however its not as if the journey was easy for him just because he carried a certain surname in fact despite averaging impressive numbers in his college days for vanderbilt commodores pippen jr went undrafted in 2022 but he later made his way to the los angeles lakers through a twoway deal under which he played for the franchises gleague team as well but he did not get much of a chance at the big league until he moved to the memphis grizzlies a post shared by nba g league nbagleague advertisement article continues below this ad meanwhile pips second child with larsa is the complete opposite of his elder brother as per an article by people scottie pippens second son with the rhom star preston pippen likes to stay away from the spotlight and this is the reason we dont have many updates on him following his high school basketball life while preston likes to stay away from the spotlight his younger brother justin seems to have thrived under it notably apart from trying his hands at basketball pips youngest son also gave modeling a try additionally justin appeared in true faces of the world campaign in 2016 with his sister sophia the campaign reportedly featured kids with different backgrounds and cultures now scottie pippens youngest and last child with larsa is his daughter sophia and she has the luxury of making the surprising claim that her godmother is kim kardashian larsas friendship with kim may have reportedly suffered a blow after her split with kanye west but it seems that the goddaughtergodmother connection still remains now its important to highlight that though pips relationship with his other children is not so sorted he shares a great bond with all his children with

Ndamukong Suh,"I played with Tom Brady, beat Patrick Mahomes to Super Bowl and learned to embrace 'hated' tag from Nike billionaire",https://talksport.com/sport/1607565/ndamukong-suh-tom-brady-super-bowl-mahomes-phil-knight/,ndamukong suh was tom bradys super bowlwinning teammate received critical life advice from nike cofounder phil knight and was once best known as the most hated player in the nfl now that suh is entering the media world while still searching for an ideal playing situation like he found last season with the philadelphia eagles one of the best defenders during the last two decades is opening up and revealing the real man behind the facemask i did everything that it took and played right to the edge suh exclusively told talksport for me youre not supposed to like me and im not doing my job if you do like me suh who was again linked with the miami dolphins after bradley chubbs injury was open honest and at ease during the interview in london where hes been living for the last month while working as an nfl analyst for sky sports the fivetime pro bowler with 600 career tackles 715 sacks and three super bowl appearances also wasnt afraid to say what he really thinks which wasnt the case during his early playing days when he realized hed been painted as a classic nfl bad guy i started to learn man the media need to have hot stories and they need to have people to talk about he said they also need to have the pretty boy in tom brady the all star in peyton manning and youve got to have the villain i was one of those villains that fit in perfectly just from that standpoint i started to embrace those things and i really learned that from phil knight mentioning brady soon had suh reflecting on tampa bays 2020 season which initially was filled with drama and question marks but ended with a dominant 319 victory over patrick mahomes and the kansas city chiefs in super bowl lv brady was a great teammate suh said the greatest quarterback of all time also put in the necessary work and knew how to get the best out of his teammates i see why hes so good just because of his work ethic and the things that he builds himself off and that mindset and focus suh said but as a true champion and this is what i learned earlier on in my career in probably my second and third year youre only as good as the people around you if theyre not bought into how you work and you cant make them better you will not move far the 13year veteran remembers a challenging midseason conversation within the buccaneers in 2020 that changed tampa bays year and pointed bruce arians team toward the top of the world guys look how talented we are and were playing at such an average level suh recalled its not because of our talent its because we havent come together as a unit and stopped being selfish arians was the perfect sideline leader for those bucs and rivals jim caldwell as the best coach that suh has played for bruce is like you guys want to win its on you like im going to give you everything suh said im going to listen to you you guys want to change things you want to run practice differently you want to do it this way do it that way well do it but at the end of the day you have ownership in this the 2010 defensive rookie of the year took arians advice to heart when tampa bay had two weeks to prepare for the big game against mahomes and the chiefs suh said that he told thendefensive coordinator todd bowles that a normal blitzheavy scheme needed to be tweaked to take down a kansas city offense that would attack the bucs secondary well attack with this front seven and trust me we will get there suh said we just ate that offensive line and their offense alive because we had that confidence and we knew what we were going to do and we were all on the same page and we believed last year suh believed that he had his second world championship wrapped up philadelphia led mahomes team 2414 at halftime with jalen hurts outplaying the biggest chief and the eagles just 30 minutes away from a shining trophy all we needed to do was on the defensive side of the ball because offense was lights out the entire time just take care of our responsibility suh said and i feel in some cases we got outcoached and outplayed in the second half of that game and obviously that led to us losing the match those emotions going through that having lost my first super bowl and then winning my second super bowl to be able to have an opportunity and be in that position to where youre like 30 minutes away from being a super bowl champion for the second time that really stung suh would have retired after the 2022 season if the eagles had won it all instead one of the games fiercest defenders relied on his young children to help him get through the pain of losing another game on the nfls biggest stage if we had won i would have probably been done suh said walk away being a champion and then ride off into the sunset and see what the media world had for me he added the only thing that really probably got me through that was knowing im coming home to my kids they dont know a difference theyre barely 2 theyre just excited a twogame suspension in 2011 for stomping on a green bay packers player ended up being a life changer for suh thanks to a private conversation with knight i went home to oregon and phil knight asked me to come meet him in his office at nike where i trained every offseason even to this day suh said and we just had an amazing hour hour and a half conversation and he just laid it out to me suh became more in control of his playing style career focus and overall image twelve years later hes waiting on one more nfl call while exploring the media world after winning a super bowl with brady and spending more than a decade as one of the leagues biggest villains suh believes that his powerful career should end up in canton ohio i dont regret anything suh said i love every moment of my career and hopefully that will surmount to me being a hall of fame player once i do decide to retire this service is provided on

Steve Kerr,"Will Jayson Tatum Lead the Charge in 2028 Olympics? Steve Kerr Decision Could Make Team USA a Boston Celtics Powerhouse, Here's How",https://www.essentiallysports.com/nba-active-basketball-news-will-jayson-tatum-lead-the-charge-in-two-thousand-twenty-eight-olympics-steve-kerr-decision-could-make-team-usa-a-boston-celtics-powerhouse-here-s-how/,more sports es fancast aug 11 2024 757 pm edt can jayson tatum turn team usa into a celticsdominated powerhouse in the 2028 olympics the announcement of the 2024 olympics roster drew criticism from many with the kind of talent available in the nba and the no of players willing to play disagreements were more than bound to happen but soon another controversy pretty much rocked the olympic boat steve kerr deciding not to play jayson tatum in the tournament opener really ruffled serious feathers but then again taking a look at the whole team usa campaign kerr has been at the receiving end of the short stick for his player combinations come 2028 when the next round of the olympics rolls up it seems like the usa basketball board could very well turn into a celtics powerhouse for one choosing derrick white over 2024 finals mvp jaylen brown after kawhi leonard withdrew his candidature had put managing director grant hill in the spotlightand not the good kind at the time hill calmed the crowd with a promise if brown was willing hed have a place in the 2028 olympic roster and for all the tatum fans this new evan sidery update on x would also prove to be quite a relief steve kerr is likely to retire as team usa head coach which means a new lead voice for 2028 in los angeles erik spoelstra is viewed as the strong internal favorite to become team usas next in line following gregg popovich and kerr advertisement article continues below this ad along with kerr lebron james kevin durant and stephen curry the threeheaded hydra of team usa are also likely to be retiring while its true that its a tough position to fill its still vacant and by 2028 theres no doubt that jt jb and white would very well adorn the veteran badge and if the 30yearold is still a celtic team usa would in effect be a celtics powerhouse poll 1 of 4 do you think jayson tatum can lead team usa to olympic gold in 2028 absolutely no way maybe if he gets more support only if steve kerr coaches have an interesting take join debate do you think adidas should have honored noah lyles instead of anthony edwards yes no both deserve recognition neither have an interesting take join debate who do you think had the biggest influence on nick meads rowing career his father his mother his siblings his coaches have an interesting take join debate what do you think about devin booker being spotted at noah lyles event supportive teammate just a fan publicity stunt coincidence have an interesting take join debate steve kerr is likely to retire as team usa head coach which means a new lead voice for 2028 in los angeles erik spoelstra is viewed as the strong internal favorite to become team usas next in line following gregg popovich and kerr pictwittercomnjym4i8cfx evan sidery esidery august 11 2024 expand tweet among those who demanded a proper explanation from steve kerr included jayson tatums mom brandy cole and the cs owner wyc grousbeck and they went public with their criticism the head coach however has played it diplomatic across the board and he delivered on the promise of bringing the gold medal back home even though the critics couldnt say much after that as even jayson was seen sharing a broad smile with his teammates lets dive deeper and see what his mother and franchise owner had to say earlier it was only a matter of time before brandy cole would be forced to put her foot down her son just led his team to an nba title in the wake of the best record in the league he earned a spot on the allnba first team for 3 years straight and received allstar recognition for 5 years so yes mama tatum was indignant and she made sure to let kerr know of it when she replied to a tweet from espns dick vitale someone pls let me know is jaytatum0 injured as he hasnt received the pt playing time u would expect an all nba player to get vitale posted from his x account cole immediately took the chance to retweet with a dig of her own no he not but if you find out whats going on please let me know unacceptable and makes no sense if kerr thought jts mom was the only one who had some words for him think again advertisement article continues below this ad kerrs actions also stupefied bostons majority owner grousbeck appearing on the greg hill show recently he said i mean i wouldnt play steve kerr let me put it that way its a complete mystery i think jayson doesnt deserve anything but praise kudos and playing time i think he and jaylen brown led us to this unbelievable championship and theyre not apparently helping the olympic team its mystifying clearly there are a lot of people who are unhappy with steve kerr but even amid such disappointing circumstances jayson tatum has his fill of happiness the nba championship obviously but the tatum family welcomed another member after the team usa win the 2x olympian and his family posed for family portraits and who else to join them but grammy winningsinger and tatums baby mama ella mai anyway the 2028 team usa roster is going to be very interesting if not for anything else to see if grant hill makes good on his word what do you think advertisement article continues below this ad before you go do not forget to

Enes Freedom,Ex NBA star Enes Kanter has $500K Turkish bounty on his head,https://nypost.com/2023/01/12/ex-nba-star-enes-kanter-has-500k-turkish-bounty-on-his-head/,former nba star enes kanter freedom who famously amended his name after becoming a us citizen in 2021 is officially a wanted man not only is his name on 2023s mostwanted terrorists list but this is the first time his former country has actually placed a published bounty on peoples heads president recep tayyip erdoans government is offering up to 10 million turkish lira or roughly 500000 for information leading to the capture of freedom who said he found out about it a week ago that makes it so dangerous freedom 30 told the post before the bounty turkish intelligence were after the people on the list but now everyone is after them because they want the money he also revealed that he is looking into suing the nba im waiting for the right time which freedom claims has blackballed him for his public protests against china during 11 seasons in the nba freedom was known for his outspokenness including against the turkish governments human rights abuses he has called out erdoan for being a dictator stepped on a photo of him at a protest and even dubbed him the hitler of our century because of my platform whenever i say something it goes everywhere and the turkish government hates that freedom said theyre really sick of it and they said enough is enough and are doing whatever they can to shut me up the athletes name appears on the turkish terrorist wanted list along with actual terrorists and fellow dissidents critical of the erdoan regime which has routinely defied international human rights law the list also names more than a dozen journalists part of a larger assault on the free press in turkey where the number of jailed journalists has doubled in the past year although freedom who now lives in washington dc admitted the bounty ups his personal security concerns he said is in constant contact with local law enforcement and the fbi im being protected 247 he said adding that he is more worried for the safety of the lesserknown turkish dissidents on erdoans list im speaking out because i am not the only one on that list freedom said of the bounty there are so many journalists so many activists and so many athletes but they arent as wellknown as me they are way easier targets and theyre alone out there the swissborn turkishraised american citizen has played for the new york knicks the boston celtics and other teams during his time in the nba but he caused a rift in the league which pulls in billions of dollars in revenue from china via nearly half a billion viewers when he became an outspoken critic of xi jinping and the chinese communist party hes also been critical of nike a major nba advertiser and player sponsor for its manufacturing deals in china freedom became known for wearing sneakers with messages like free tibet free uyghur and no beijing 2022 painted by dissident artists during games and has said he was pressured by the league to take off his shoes and keep his mouth shut his refusal to do so led to a tiff with nba star lebron james in 2019 i tweeted that hong kong should be free then le bron said he is not educated enough about the situation to comment on it and that what i tweeted hurt the league freedom told the post in 2021 its sad that these players are social justice warriors but when it comes to china they are scared to say anything your values are more important than any money you can ever make from china now freedom says hes been blackballed by the nba after being traded to the houston rockets from the boston celtics in february he was quickly dropped he averaged 117 minutes 37 points and 46 rebounds last season the nba is never going to admit it but i believe im being blackballed he told the post ive had many conversations and everyone is saying the same thing your career has ended because of your china comments now freedom is waiting for the right time to sue the league they are a 100 american made organization but they are being controlled and run by the biggest dictatorship in the world china he said how can china fire an american citizen from an american organization that is unacceptable the league office has had no involvement in team roster decisions involving mr freedom nba spokesman mike bass told the post nba commissioner adam silver speaking with the new york times this past march denied that kanter is being blackballed we spoke directly about his activities this season silver said at the time and i made it absolutely clear to him that it was completely within his right to speak out on issues that he was passionate about since leaving the nba he is running interfaith basketball camps for children to foster unity and has been traveling the world to meet with leaders as a human rights activist although 2023 is the first year freedom appeared on the terrorist wanted list his conflict with the turkish government is ongoing leaders revoked his passport in 2017 and requested an interpol red notice asking law enforcement worldwide to arrest pending extradition in 2019 his father mehmet was jailed in turkey and the family was forced to disown freedom for their own safety the athlete said its been nearly 10 years since he spoke to themand yet they are still being harassed back in turkey according to freedom my dad went to a market and people spit on his face he said and my mom cant walk outside freely because she gets harassed freedom said he hopes to call attention to the turkish governments cruelty i really want to show the world what kind of person erdoan is western leaders are not doing enough theyre playing softball with this dictatorship freedom said diplomacy is important but on the other side of the world people are losing their lives their homes and their loved ones advertisement,2023-01-12T21:53:30Z,,"['former', 'nba', 'star', 'ene', 'kanter', 'freedom',

usas mens basketball team handed france a defeat in the finals the womens team did the same they defeated the host nation by a narrow 6766 margin on sunday to claim their eighth consecutive gold at the olympics despite these efforts and achievements stephen a smith believes team usa missed an opportunity and hes not apologetic for saying this on august 13th smith unveiled his perspective via his official youtube channel when you talk about marketing the sport i think team usa missed an opportunity to elevate the profile of womens excellence in the sport of basketball because they ignored marketing he said after applauding team usas women for returning with their eighth consecutive gold around their necks for smith caitlin clark was an opportunity team usa could have seized her addition to team usa would have been a marketing boost box office matters we want to act like it doesnt matter but it does he added for context 4 of team usas games over the past week drew an audience

the mens basketball team is taking advantage of marketing opportunities its not an accident i saw anthony edwards with those adidas shoes or lebron james with his goldplated shoes but i saw that

Stephen Curry,Fact Check: Did Stephen Curry Make McDonald's France Remove Classic Menu Item?,https://www.essentiallysports.com/nba-active-basketball-news-fact-check-did-stephen-curry-make-mcdonald-s-france-remove-classic-menu-item/,more sports es fancast aug 12 2024 918 am edt via reuters paris 2024 olympics basketball mens victory ceremony bercy arena paris france august 10 2024 gold medallist stephen curry of united states bites his medal reutersevelyn hockstein via reuters paris 2024 olympics basketball mens victory ceremony bercy arena paris france august 10 2024 gold medallist stephen curry of united states bites his medal reutersevelyn hockstein did stephen curry really make mcdonalds france change their menu whats your take on this wild rumor for over 15 years now stephen curry has been an influential figure in american basketball by winning four championship titles setting himself as the alltime threepointer leader and winning several accolades he has become a household name domestically the 2024 paris olympics gave him the opportunity to prove his worth on the international stage as well as he led team usa to his fifth consecutive gold medal however was his influence in the olympics strong enough to consider bringing about a change in the menu of frances mcdonalds as it turns out the answer is yes although it was not something that the player personally set out to do in the aftermath of the finals of the mens basketball tournament between team usa and france the official instagram handle of mcdonalds france uploaded a post carrying a picture of their classic curry sauce as a joke a caption was placed right on top of the sauce that read pour des raisons evidentes on songe a retirer cette sauce which literally translates to for obvious reasons we are considering removing this sauce another caption was put on the side that stated pour 4 ans minimum for at least 4 years it wouldnt have taken a genius to put two and two together to understand the context behind this post stephen curry initially struggled to make a mark during the paris olympics he blamed it on the fiba rules and standards that were quite different from the ones established by the nba however he boldly put his ultimate prowess on display during the semifinals against serbia which team usa was on the brink of losing the 36yearold repeated his actions during the final as well by securing a score of 24 points 1 rebound and 5 assists against france as he went 813 with his field goals and 812 with his threepointers advertisement article continues below this ad four of those faraway shots were made in a consecutive manner within the final 3 minutes by the time the gold medal was in his hand the golden state warriors star had emerged as team usas leading scorer setting an olympic record for the most threepointers made in a final game in light of this the billiondollar fastfood brand thought of cracking a joke at the expense of frances loss this is a joke in reference to yesterdays basketball game and stephen currys huge performance a spokesperson for mcdonalds france stated in an email to cnn poll 1 of 4 do you think stephen currys influence is strong enough to change mcdonalds menu absolutely no way maybe but not sure who cares have an interesting take join debate which of scottie pippens seven kids do you think will make the biggest impact in sports antron pippen scotty pippen jr preston pippen sierra pippen justin pippen sophia pippen taylor pippen have an interesting take join debate who do you think handled the anthony edwards and adidas controversy better anthony edwards adidas noah lyles usain bolt have an interesting take join debate do you think dennis rodman was a good father to alexis yes no its complicated not sure have an interesting take join debate chef curry saved team usa from a loss against serbia in the semis and was the most influential in the finals victory without him the us basketball team might have had to walk away without a medal and france might have finished on top therefore by keeping the item on their menu mcdonalds france may not have wanted to hand out a daily reminder to consumers about the man who cost them their gold however if mcdonalds wants to take the joke further they can allow the curry sauce to make an appearance in us locations with the 2028 olympics set to take place in la fans would need it to remind them of the player who brought the previous medal home stephen currys name and the name of the mcdonalds sauce are a simple coincidence but thanks to their dominance on the nba court many basketball athletes have had some specific dishes named after them some have been bestowed this honor while others have just created these food items by themselves carmelo anthony entered the nba in 2003 as part of one of the most promising draft classes of all time later on he devoted the next 19 years of his life living up to that standard securing his name in the nba allstar team on 10 occasions winning four medals three gold one bronze at the olympics and getting himself named to the nba 75 anniversary team however amongst all these accolades it would be remiss to not mention the sandwich that carnegie deli named especially in his honor introduced back in 2011 the melo is a monstrous food item it is a skyscraper of meats as it contains over 35 pounds of pastrami salami corned beef bacon and to keep the sandwich a bit healthy lettuce and tomato filling one stomach would also drain ones wallet since according to cbs news the melo cost 2195 when introduced the reasoning behind the price was based on the fact that selling 3 million of the melo sandwiches would secure 65 million in sales the same price that cost the new york knicks in its extension deal with the player during his stint with the cleveland cavaliers matthew dellavedova created a reputation for being a player who would often engage in physical antics on the court in fact according to a poll conducted by the los angeles times in 2016 he was ranked as the nbas dirtiest player despite this he had a thing not many of his peers did a burger named after him in may 2015 in order to celebrate national burger day and the cavaliers securing a perfect 40 record during the conference finals the cleveland cavaliers introduced the delly burger being sold at a concession stand outside the basketball arena the food item consisted of salami capicola provolone gritty arugula roasted peppers and a tough texture of red wine vinaigrette at 975 the burger might not have been that appealing to the eye but would have tasted different in honor of nationalburgerday east champs

kiddgilchrist was honored with a burger bearing his name at the cowfish sushi burger bar in charlotte the turkey burger consisted of a raclette spinach fried leeks and a topping of hot pepper jelly it will be rare for the nba world to see a player like shaquille oneal again on the basketball court if there is one thing that longtime fans know about him it is that the fourtime nba champion loves food as a result he set out to share his love by introducing not just one food item bearing his name but a whole restaurant founded in 2018 the big chicken restaurant chain is shaqs brainchild while it was only in 18 locations by june 2023 it is currently expanding at a rapid rate and will operate in over 300 stores soon specializing in louisianastyle fried chicken sandwiches many of the offerings are named after shaq himself examples include the shaq attack shaq daddy big aristotle shaq fu bbq and superman via imago credits big chicken shaq has also named several sandwiches to honor some of the closest people in his life one of them includes philadelphia 76ers legend shaqs former rival and his recent inside the nba cohost charles barkley after all with an item named the charles

elevate kobe bryants brand to the same legendary status as michael jordans the united states mens basketball team clinched gold for the fifth consecutive time by defeating france on saturday night in the 2024 paris olympics although busy with training for the mike tyson fight on november 15th jake paul made time to watch team usa succeed in the biggest games of the world meanwhile he came up with the idea that the sports apparel brand nike should sign more players to the kobe bryant brand such an idea is not a new thing paul came up with alonefans of the late nba legend have made similar demands in the past jake paul happens to be a more headlinefriendly sort of person its worth noting that nikes kobe brand launched in 2005 is a line of basketball shoes and other merchandise created in collaboration with bryant one of the greatest nba players of all time it includes signature sneakers apparel and accessories regardless paul wants nike to build a brand around bryant like they did for michael jordan in 1997 all this transpired on social media as paul roped in kobes wife vanessa bryant in the loop advertisement article continues below this ad while watching the summer olympics last basketball game paul hopped onto x and wrote nike needs to sign players to the kobe brand just like jordan seeing so many men and women ball players wearing kobes at the olympics 81024 lets get that gold for mamba he isnt wrong many of the olympic basketball players were sporting bryants retro nikes during many of the games is jake paul right to demand nike treat kobes brand like michael jordans react reactions a post shared by betr betr if that doesnt convince you heres more even though nikes only released retro models so far the kobe line is still the most popular performance basketball shoe out there and the good news nikes already making moves in the right direction they relaunched the kobe brand last august with more sneaker drops and mamba programs in the ncaa still nike hasnt fully created a kobe brand like jordan brand just yet plus if nike does decide to kobes wife vanessa bryant should have the final say according to jake paul after paul put his thoughts out there he soon clarified his stance adding meant with full respect and admiration of course its vanessa bryant who has to make that decision the posts were then shared together by pauls sports betting app betrs instagram page interestingly when jordan launched his sublabel in 1997 it included signing five nba players which later expanded into nfl and mlb and this isnt the first time pauls shown his love and respect for the late nba legend advertisement article continues below this ad back in january jake paul opened up about the mix of emotions he felt during his professional boxing debut which happened at a pretty tough time for sports fans on january 26 2020 the world was hit hard by the devastating news of nba legend kobe bryants tragic death along with his daughter gigi and seven others in a helicopter crash as paul was gearing up for his first pro fight that same week he couldnt help but feel the weight of the loss especially since kobe was admired worldwide for his mamba mentality and unstoppable work ethic my first pro debuts fight week started on jan 26 2020 it was a very sad way to start my boxing career since then ive looked to learn from kobe bryant work ethic mamba mentality daily legends are forever rest in peace pictwittercomubcyyvehjp jake paul jakepaul january 26 2024 expand tweet advertisement article continues below this ad in a touching post on x paul talked about how bryants legacy has been a huge inspiration for him shaping the way he approaches his boxing career even though that week was heavy with grief paul managed to push through and came out on top in his debut defeating fellow youtuber anesongib with a firstround tko looking back jake paul paid tribute to bryant recognizing how much the basketball icons influence still drives him both in life and in the ring despite the lack of a complete brand around kobe bryant every time nike drops bryant sneakers the demand is difficult to keep up with meaning its safe to say that it wont be an unprofitable endeavor for nike still whether such a thing happens is yet to be seen would you like to see nike sign players to the kobe brand essentiallysports is a digitalfirst sports media house

Pau Gasol,Team USA's Kobe Bryant forgot Pau Gasol was his Lakers teammate during 2008 Olympics and ran through him in true sign of 'Mamba Mentality',https://talksport.com/sport/1914025/team-usa-kobe-bryant-pau-gasol-lakers-olympics/,kobe bryant was known around the world as the black mamba it was moniker inspired after the late great los angeles lakers legend watched quentin tarantinos kill bill and needed something to separate himself from his oncourt persona in the film the black mamba snake known for its agility and aggressiveness was used as a code name for a deadly assassin it was nickname befitting of one of the most competitive players to ever suit up in the nba in 2008 bryant and the rest of team usa were looking for revenge four years prior theyd been embarrassed at the olympic games in athens finishing with a bronze medal 16 years earlier the original dream team led by hall of famers michael jordan charles barkley larry bird and magic johnson destroyed everyone en route to olympic gold and set the standard for all subsequent teams to aspire to while the 04 team was no dream team it was still a starstudded squad bursting with nba talent and a third place finish on the world stage was simply unforgivable team usa needed to salvage its global standing it had to reclaim gold in 2008 their solution bring in reigning mvp kobe bryant who had never played in the olympics before but was seething after an nba finals defeat to bitter rivals boston and was desperate to see the us reestablish themselves atop the international basketball food chain the redeem team had found its leader one that could take a talented but inexperienced group including carmelo anthony dwyane wade and lebron james and turn them into ruthless winners team usa headed to beijing china in the summer of 08 as the overwhelming favourites but reigning world champions spain were still the team to beat after blowout wins against china angola and greece team usa faced spain in a preliminary round game both teams were undefeated thus far 30 but one narrative in particular dominated the build up to the contest kobe vs pau earlier that year 7footer gasol had been traded to los angeles to play alongside bryant and fill the lakers shaqsized hole that had been gaping for years the bigmanlittleman combo immediately hit it off forming an potent partnership that saw them finish the season 279 and reach the nba finals ahead of the game vs spain bryant told reporters that he and gasol are like brothers and that going against each other wouldnt be easy im very happy for him that hes playing well bryant said i mean were very very tight so its a little tough to compete against him his locker room message was one of an entirely different tone kobe said he was gonna set the tone to start the game and he said im running through paus chest lebron revealed in netflixs redeem team documentary james said the us players responded man you tripping thats your teammate you tripping you aint about to do this first play of the game im running through pau gasol and we was like what dwyane wade added he said first play of the game i know what theyre gonna run and he knew pau was gonna be the last screen and he said im running through him sure enough spain ran the play bryant was expecting in the first few minutes of the contest gasol attempted to set a screen on bryant who ran straight through him at full force and knocked him over to the ground bryant was called for the foul and stood over his lakers teammate as a bewildered gasol looked around as if to check what had just happened kobe had sent a message not just to pau and spain but to his own teammates without uttering a single word he was like no he aint my teammate right now fk him get up carmelo anthony said im like i love this energy this is what we need right now he just went right into the middle of my chest tried to get right through me to send a message gasol explained in the documentary not just to me but to his teammates to say hey this might be my brother i play with him were close but i dont care about anything else but winning we was like oh aint no way were losing this game lebron added we about to beat the sht out of spain team usa went on to cruise to a 37point victory with bryant finishing with 11 points in only 16 minutes of action the united states and spain met again in the gold medal game in what turned out to be a much closer affair kobe hit big shots down the stretch and finished with 20 points as the redeem team clinched a 118107 victory bryant had set out what he achieved to do winning gold for team usa and avenging the humiliation of 2004 the way hed done it embodying his mamba mentality attacking whats in front of you with passion and purpose without fear and doubt was what made it so special inadvertently hed also helped gasol and the lakers i sincerely believed pau benefited from the collision more than anyone else michael lee of the washington post told netflix he got to see how intensely kobe approached the game and it helped him develop the mentality he was going to need to go back to back the lakers were going to be good but they wouldnt be great by being happygolucky the team from tinseltown won consecutive titles with bryant and gasol leading the way beating the magic in 2009 and the celtics in 2010 bryant rejoined the national team for the 2012 summer olympics and won another gold meal his second overall he finished his national team career with a record of 260 across three tournaments including the usa fiba americas championship winning a gold medal each time his international peak undoubtedly came in 2008 though when the entire world saw what mamba mentality was all about for gasol that was as good as if not better than anything the original dream team ever did kobe came and they brought their ateam he said i think that was probably as good or better than the potentially original dream team if you ask me gasol is one of the greatest international players in nba history winning two titles alongside bryant the spanish big man was a sixtime allstar and nba rookie of the year he also has an illustrious international career having won a fiba world cup title three eurobasket titles two olympic silver medals and an olympic bronze

Magic Johnson,"Dream Team’s Michael Jordan, Charles Barkley and Magic Johnson showed ultimate act of loyalty during ’92 Olympics with defiant act during gold medal ceremony",https://talksport.com/sport/1951106/michael-jordan-barkley-magic-dream-team-olympics-nike-reebok/,michael jordan is nike nike is michael jordan the most marketable athlete in the history of north american sports has been intertwined with the venerated swoosh brand ever since he put pen to paper on a fiveyear 25million endorsement deal in 1984 mike and nikes relationship eventually birthed the iconic air jordan sneakers a landmark shoe that became a major status symbol in footwear and streetwear culture around the globe nikes ascendancy from oregonbased shoe brand to multibillion dollar apparel corporation coincided with his airness rising to the summit of the association by 1992 twotime champion and twotime finals mvp jordan had surpassed magic johnson and larry bird as the undisputed face of the nba and was about to take his talents overseas nba initially players werent allowed to participate in the olympics but that all changed in 1989 when fiba removed the rule so in 1992 team usa head coach chuck daily assembled an avengersesqe squad bursting with nba talent that was tasked with one simple goal winning an olympic gold medal jordan magic and bird were joined by fellow hall of famers charles barkley david robinson karl malone and patrick ewing among others who descended on barcelona spain with beatleslike fanfare and with the mission of putting on a basketball clinic the starstudded squad was aptly named the dream team because of their ethereal talents and they predictably stomped on every team who dared to step in their way the consensus greatest sports team ever assembled were unbeaten en route to the gold medal that summer averaging more than 117 points per game and winning by an average margin of 44 points team usa defeated croatia 11785 in the gold medal game and nike ambassador jordan was suddenly faced with a difficult dilemma brand rival reebok had secured exclusive rights to produce warmup outfits and other apparel for american athletes including dream team members at the 92 olympics reebok reportedly paid 4 million for the rights to team usas medal stand jackets and the us olympic committee made it clear that winners had to accept medals while wearing jackets emblazoned with the reebok logo they said if we dont wear our uniforms we cant accept our gold medal jordan said at the time but it wasnt just mjs brand loyalties that were about to be tested of the 12 dream team members none were reebok endorsers while six including jordan and barkley were nike athletes us cocaptains magic and bird were longtime converse advocates something had to give and it was increasingly apparent that none of the players were about to jeopardize highly lucrative sponsorship deals by rocking a rival brand in front of millions of eyes and so as they went up to the podium to receive their gold medals all 12 dream team players unzipped their jackets so that the collars obscured the reebok sponsor patch jordan the trailblazer that he is went one step further the chicago bulls legend covered the reebok logo on the right shoulder by draping himself in the red white and blue of the american flag they cant hide it like im gonna hide it jordan said they in for a big fing surprise barkley and magic were the only other players who followed suit and covered the reebok insignia with the american flag us nike guys are loyal to nike because they pay us a lot of money sir charles told reporters at the time i have 2 million reasons not to wear reebok jordan barkley and magics defiant stance worked like a charm there wasnt a reebok patch in sight when the starspangled banner rang out around the spanish arena straight after the medal ceremony had taken place jordan tossed the reebok jacket to brian mcintyre a member of the nbas public relations squad telling him he could have it i certainly dont want it he told mcintyre mcintyre looked after the jacket which has a patch that reads reebok is proud to honor americas finest for two years thinking jordan would eventually want it back in 1994 mcintyre bumped into mj at an event and tried to hand the item back to him instead jordan signed it to brian thanks for everything michael jordan mcintyre kept the jacket for nearly 30 years it remains a timeless piece of basketball memorabilia and in 2023 sold through sothebys for 15 million the jacket is so much more than just a piece of memorabilia though its an important artefact that serves as a powerful reminder of the enduring strength of brand jordan and his unparalleled impact on sports fashion and culture everyone agreed we would not deface the reebok on the award uniform jordan said of the decision to cover up the jacket at the time the american flag cannot deface anything thats what we stand for the american dream is standing up for what you believe in i believed in it and i stood up for it if i offended anyone thats too bad when you hire 12 clint eastwoods to come in

the community in the last few weeks has witnessed memorable moments snubs and bigtime controversies we tell you along with bringing back lebron james after he last played in 2012 steph curry and anthony edwards also made it to the roster the issue arose when derrick white was sent as kawhis replacement instead of jaylen brown 2016 gold medallist kyrie irving was also excluded with 8 years younger tyrese haliburton despite the uproar and draymond criticizing his own gsw coach another exwarrior believes that what happened was for the best demarcus cousins and quinn cook discussed tyrese haliburtons inclusion in the team usa roster quinn initiated the topic stating you need a guy whos not gonna be mad when not playing this was an indirect dig at jaylen brown as the team usa roster was reportedly concerned whether someone of jaylen browns caliber would accept having a significantly reduced role therefore with the team filled with dominating scorers like lebron kd etc the need was for a player who wouldnt mind staying on the sidelines obviously jaylen brown kyrie irving from a talent perspective and what theyve done even with their resumes theyre supposed to be on the team but when youre putting a team together just sometimes you need your derrick white quinn cook said on above the rim with dh 12 the topic of the basketball world has been jayson tatum not playing yeah if derrick white dont play thats expected advertisement article continues below this ad being the secondincommand in their respective franchises both jaylen brown and kyrie irving are expected to carry the offensive effort which grants them more oncourt minutes during the nba finals between the boston celtics and the dallas mavericks brown averaged 385 minutes throughout five games while irving

minutes being used up to add only 4 points in the finals against serbia in contrast lebron james has averaged 205 minutes at the paris olympics while kevin durant just 196 therefore irvings previous record of taking up a bulk of the minutes which may or may not generate the required points may have played a role in his exclusion after jaylen brown hinted that his exclusion from team usa was because of his sour relationship with nike the teams managing director grant hill was quick to come out with a response he went on to state that the responsibility that i have is to put together a team and a team that complements each other he had to decide on these grounds even if it meant not taking in finals mvp as highlighted by quinn cook the management simply may not have believed that taking in jaylen brown andor kyrie irving would have been worthwhile if they had just remained on the sidelines another exnba player however had a stronger reasoning siding with the celts nike agenda and providing more reasons for the same now that weve opened this can of worms lets dive deeper after jaylen brown made headlines for blaming nike reactions started to pour in from all sides many former nba players including gilbert arenas and rashad mccants agreed with the celtics stars sentiment during a segment of his gils arena podcast the wizards legend even went on to state that team usa was allegedly a nike event that just sidelined players who arent a part of the billiondollar brand mccants highlighted that both players were at one point in time associated with the brand until complications arose jaylen brown sided with kyrie irving he spoke out against nike dropping kyrie said mccants nike dropped kyrie after the post jaylen brown didnt like that i think he was the president of the players association at the time he was obligated to speak out about what nike did why they did it he didnt like it he was wearing kobes at the time so he started covering up his kobes

ending the endorsement deal that they signed with the player in 2014 by that point it had been 3 years since irving had left the celtics and much of the boston fanbase had turned against the player advertisement article continues below this ad despite this brown in his capacity as vp of the nba players association stated his disagreement with the terms that irving needed to fulfill for his franchise suspension to be revoked when it came to nike brown took to his official x account and wrote since when did nike care about ethics this according to reports is what soured the relationship between nike and the 2024 nba champion after grant hill went on to state that brown blaming nike was just a conspiracy theory the celt had to remind him that as vp of the nba players association he has a great understanding of how things work brown and irving may have been excluded from the 2024 roster simply because of the playing minutes issue however no one can deny the fishyness that this

younger tyrese haliburton despite the uproar and draymond criticizing his own gsw coach another exwarrior believes that what happened was for the best demarcus cousins and quinn cook discussed tyrese haliburtons inclusion in the team usa roster quinn initiated the topic stating you need a guy whos not gonna be mad when not playing this was an indirect dig at jaylen brown as the team usa roster was

minutes being used up to add only 4 points in the finals against serbia in contrast lebron james has averaged 205 minutes at the paris olympics while kevin durant just 196 therefore irvings previous record of taking up a bulk of the minutes which may or may not generate the required points may have played a role in his exclusion after jaylen brown hinted that his exclusion from team usa was because of his sour relationship with nike the teams managing director grant hill was quick to come out with a response he went on to state that the responsibility that i have is to put together a team and a team that complements each other he had to decide on these grounds even if it meant not taking in finals mvp as highlighted by quinn cook the management simply may not have believed that taking in jaylen brown andor kyrie irving would have been worthwhile if they had just remained on the sidelines another exnba player however had a stronger reasoning siding with the celts nike agenda and providing more reasons for the same now that weve opened this can of worms lets dive deeper after jaylen brown made headlines for blaming nike reactions started to pour in from all sides many former nba players including gilbert arenas and rashad mccants agreed with the celtics stars sentiment during a segment of his gils arena podcast the wizards legend even went on to state that team usa was allegedly a nike event that just sidelined players who arent a part of the billiondollar brand mccants highlighted that both players were at one point in time associated with the brand until complications arose jaylen brown sided with kyrie irving he spoke out against nike dropping kyrie said mccants nike dropped kyrie after the post jaylen brown didnt like that i think he was the president of the players association at the time he was obligated to speak out about what nike did why they did it he didnt like it he was wearing kobes at the time so he started covering up his kobes

garden mandatory credit david butler iiusa today sports back in 2022 kyrie irving suffered from repercussions after he posted antisemitic content online this involved the nets suspending him and nike ending the endorsement deal that they signed with the player in 2014 by that point it had been 3 years since irving had left the celtics and much of the boston fanbase had turned against the player advertisement article continues below this ad despite this brown in his capacity as vp of the nba players association stated his disagreement with the terms that irving needed to fulfill for his franchise suspension to be revoked when it came to nike brown took to his official x account and wrote since when did nike care about ethics this according to reports is what soured the relationship between nike and the 2024 nba champion after grant hill went on to state that brown blaming nike was just a conspiracy theory the celt had to remind him that as vp of the nba players association he has a great understanding of how things work brown and irving may have been excluded from the 2024 roster simply because of the playing minutes issue however no one can deny the fishyness that this

Blake Griffin,“Blake Griffin... Was Like a Monster”: Shaq’s Former Agent Says Michael Jordan Talk Not Anthony Edwards’ Biggest Concern,https://www.essentiallysports.com/nba-active-basketball-news-blake-griffin-was-like-a-monster-shaqs-former-agent-says-michael-jordan-talk-not-anthony-edwards-biggest-concern/,more sports es fancast jun 14 2024 915 am edt anthony edwards season ended in the western conference finals but by all accounts he had a breakout year and how comparisons to michael jordan started following him everywhere its not about his stunning vertical scary offensive maneuvers or even trash talk charismatic confidence and the talent to back it up are very subtle jordanesque traits he displays hes played it humble on the mj topic so far but you can see him riding on it or at least social media cant look past it his kobe bryantinspired adidas campaign gave jordan vibes to most but is it taking away from ants identity vishal kolar asked leonard armato the brandbuilder to the pros like shaq just that on his second sitdown with essentiallysports its easy to throw out mj comparisons but kolar asked if this is damaging to antmans brand and his dreams to be the future face of the league as per armato its a fine line armato i dont think he has to take the bait on it if people want to compare him to michael jordan let em all he has to do is say jordan is one of a kind and i have ultimate respect for him i think anthony edwards is sort of a different kind of guy fun young certainly youthful in so many different aspects of his personality explosive and incredibly fun to watch advertisement article continues below this ad edwards has the desire to be the face of the league in all aspects hes getting there but it wont be immediately jordan was a star before the championships but it was only when he led the chicago bulls to the finals for the first time that national networks took the nba as a primetime commodity expanded sponsorships and even influenced fashion when it could be said that his airness was the true face of the league before edwards can get there he has to be consistent and healthy armato itll be interesting to see how his career evolves he hasnt gotten to the promised land yet he certainly is looking forward to getting there i dont know if it will be this year but if he perseveres if he stays healthy he could have an incredible career but you dont know i mean look people get injured at times you never know look at blake griffin the guy was like a monster and then he had those injuries and really did debilitate him theres a lot of people whove suffered injuries especially high flyers and youve seen some of the things hes done its scary i mean hes fallen on his back blocking shots and youre wondering if hes okay so lets just see how this thing evolves certainly hes super fun to watch hes a charismatic kid and you know underneath it all hes a bit in his showoff stuff but at the same time i think hes got a good heart and hes a good kid and people really like him armato is right that the high flyers like edwards are at high risk hes been severely prone to injuries but when push comes to shove he cannot sit down he has to perform and lead his team edwards embraces the pain and plays through that with the bravest of smiles hip injuries twisting his ankle fingers and knees anything and everything yet he puts his best foot forward on the court advertisement article continues below this ad during game 6 against the denver nuggets edwards had a scary fall on his back they won game 6 and assured fans hed still play the wolves won the series in game 7 and armato was looking forward to the conference finals at the time of the interview which they ended up losing even though minnesota fans were disappointed by that defeat fans still had a lot of fun watching him play armato elevates edwards good heart which not enough people talk about hes engaging in an interview and not a braggart as he seems on court antman initially accepted the mj talk gracefully but in may he flat out said i want it to stop he explained his reasoning hes the greatest of all time i cant be compared to him advertisement article continues below this ad even the greatest arent immune though michael jordan was 22 during the infamous broken foot season in 1985 edwards entered the nba at 19 and is 22 now making veterans reminisce rookie jordan you dont have to rewatch the last dance to know it wasnt easy for jordan to overcome that setback and very few have replicated such a comeback the comparisons will be nothing unless edwards maintains his physical condition and longevity essentiallysports is a digitalfirst sports media

Wesley Sneijder,The Man United transfer saga involving ex-Real Madrid ace Jose Mourinho loved who 'could have been as good as Lionel Messi',https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/transfer-news/manchester-united-sneijder-scholes-ferguson-27577462,manchester united have been embroiled in their fair share of transfer sagas even in his short time in the old trafford hot seat erik ten hag has encountered such issues with his prolonged pursuit of frenkie de jong rarely far from the back pages but ultimately unsuccessful some other names have become almost running jokes among the fanbase as the reds have been linked with them every time the transfer window opens there was a time when wesley sneijder fell into that category at the time paul scholes was heading into the twilight of his career the class of 92 graduate was heading for a career break in 2011 before coming out of retirement in 2012 for 18 months sir alex ferguson knew a replacement would need to be brought to the club also read ten hag needs to solve a problem ferguson admitted to having at united during this period sneijder was one of the most gifted and talked about midfielders in world football evening once claiming he could have been as good as lionel messi and cristiano ronaldo he had helped jose mourinhos inter milan win the treble in the 200910 season before playing an important role in the netherlands run to the world cup final with uniteds need for a new central midfielder and sneijders reputation its no surprise that the reds were linked with a move in july 2011 the daily mail ran a story regarding the dutchman which stated he had agreed a 35m transfer a month later the move was off but where does the truth lie regarding the sneijder to united transfer saga men sport has taken a look in the eyes of uniteds legendary manager a deal for sneijder was never on the table during uniteds preseason tour of the us in 2011 ferguson told espn i keep reading about this theres absolutely nothing at all to that the blunt response to a transfer rumour from ferguson was no surprise the boss never had time for gossip indeed the scot doubled down on his reply 10 years later thats come up a lot of times but we were never interested in sneijder he explained i dont know where that came from but you get a lot of them sneijder has a very different recollection of uniteds reported interest in him shortly after joining galatasaray in 2013 the midfielder opened up on the legendary manager having talks with his team we had some talks with alex ferguson back in 2010 he told galatasaray dergisi united contacted them inter after our treble season but too much money was asked for and i was also happy at inter so i decided to stay manchester united are a fantastic club and they kept showing interest after that year but not as determined as before i dont give much thought about proposed transfers if im happy somewhere im happy there fast forward to 2023 and sneijder had passed the blame away from inter and towards his own agent well actually i was close in 2011 sneijder told sportbible i was close in 2011 after the champions league and after the world cup but then what i heard later is that because at a certain point we were talking with united and at a certain point there was nothing anymore uniteds adidas home shirt is made up of the same colour of the citys iconic red rose and features a black collar the collar also features a dash of both red and white giving it a slick and modernised look prices start from 55 and i asked my manager what happened with united and he said no nothing its over but two years later i found out that he asked for extra money for himself so thats why the deal was over so actually ferguson he told one of my relatives as always with transfer speculation the truth lies somewhere in the middle interest from united at the time does make sense sneijder fit the bill for what ferguson would have wanted however it is also likely the deal never got close if sneijders agent was looking for a bigger cut than was being agreed ferguson was renowned for having little time for agents who were for want of a better phrase too big for their boots if what sneijder explained regarding his manager was true it is unsurprising ferguson never saw the midfielder as a solid addition to the squad like with many stars the dutchmans failed move is another what if moment in uniteds storied history follow the mens united coverage on tiktok and youtube and subscribe to

Pelé,Freddy Adu was a Football Manager legend and had a following like Lionel Messi - I almost signed him for Billericay Town,https://talksport.com/football/1958901/freddy-adu-lionel-messi-jamie-ohara-billericay-town/,freddy adu was once touted as the next pele he signed a 500k contract at the age of 14 then almost ended up in englands nonleague football manager fans will remember just how good adu was and it was because of the popular game that fans anticipated a special talent on the horizon in penning his contract at dc united he became the highest paid mls player he was 14 and the youngestever professional athlete in america nike were quickly onto this once in a generation talent two years later in 2006 he even earned a trial at manchester united under the watchful eye of sir alex ferguson freddy has done all right ferguson said of the player then 17 he is a talented boy hell go back to the us and well keep a check on him when he is 18 we will have to assess what we can do next but it turned out to be adus only brush with english football though not if talksports jamie ohara had his way the former tottenham midfielder was a former player and manager of the isthmian league club and admits he was close to signing the player who had the sort of cult following david beckham enjoyed in america and which lionel messi is now used to i nearly signed him at billericay but we couldnt get him a work permit ohara confessed on the sports bar hes still knocking about somewhere he is still playing and what a coup that would have been for the essex club despite never living up to the high expectation placed on him now aged 35 adu has been without a club since 2021 and despite never officially retiring from the game he now spends his time coaching kids adu enjoyed spells in the united states brazil france portugal turkey serbia finland and most recently sweden he did play for big teams in europe though like benfica where he played alongside angel di maria and monaco but says this was a turning point in him becoming a socalled journeyman the one decision i made that i would done differently is when i left benfica after one year and went on loan to monaco in 2008 he told cbs sports that started the snowball of me having to go on loan from team to team because i wasnt patient enough at benfica as well as acknowledging he could have been more dedicated to becoming the best adu cited di maria as someone who did remain patient in portugal a new coach came in he played and next thing you know he goes to real madrid he recalled i go to monaco and there was a power struggle between coach ricardo gomes and president he wanted me really bad but the coach didnt feel like i was ready things may not have gone the way adu had envisaged for his career but he will be forever cherished as a football manager legend despite his worldwide acclaim on the game adu previously admitted he received barrages of messages from fans i get a lot of tweets with people calling me a football manager legend and im like damn i wish it was like that in real life he joked in an interview in 2014 i havent played that game but i have a lot of friends that have and theyve told me about it so thats pretty cool catch the sports bar on talksport every weeknight from 10pm this

Ja Morant,Nike Faces Backlash on Latest Ja Morant Leak Ahead of Grizzlies Star's Highly Anticipated NBA

center mandatory credit stephen lewusa today sports usa today via reuters dec 26 2023 new orleans louisiana usa memphis grizzlies guard ja morant 12 looks on during the first half against the new orleans pelicans at smoothie king center mandatory credit stephen lewusa today sports is nikes latest ja morant leak a marketing genius or a complete disaster the memphis grizzlies and all their fans are eagerly waiting for the 202425 season to start with a slew of unfortunate incidents to their franchise superstar and other key players the grizzlies could never catch a break but now with the latest update on ja morant it seems like the season cant start soon enough in the meantime morant has no plans of leaving his fans stranded as the photos of his latest kicks have taken the internet by storm the nike ja 2 stargazer truly does justice to the name as opposed to his lowtop ja 1 the latest shoes feature a higher cut in addition the ripple effect detail around the swoosh tends to naturally draw the customers eyes to the vibrant purple colorway couple that with the rumored 120 price point its sure to sell like hotcakes thoughts on ja morants new shoe ja morants upcoming nike ja 2 has recently surfaced online in a stargazer colorway nicekickshoops the pair is rumored to be releasing in october for 120 nicekicks posted on instagram advertisement article continues below this ad a post shared by nice kicks nicekicks the nike ja 1 officially hit the markets in early 2023 almost a 15year gap certainly makes sense given the year morants had hence this news comes like a breath of fresh air however coach taylor jenkins provided a health update on ja morant just a few days earlier during a recent summer league broadcast jenkins confirmed that ja was indeed cleared for full basketball activities ja its go time so very encouraged medically cleared full go crossed all the hurdles hes been phenomenal with his rehab now its full go basketball with him with all the contact now its been more on the body getting that back in the right spot but now hes full go basketballwise we can dive into his basketball plan he said from his 25game suspension for brandishing a gun to the labrum tear during practice the season had effectively ended for the 24yearold memphis had seen a steady rise in their rankings in the nine games morant played in between unfortunately that was it as the grizzlies finished 13th in the west but as mentioned above fans cant help but be excited to see their young franchise star out on the court even so there are still a few unhappy fans on instagram who look nonetoopleased with his stargazer straight off the bat this fan put forward a serious argument nike design team and creativity need to have a meeting because seriously this shoe looks like a lebron mixed with a kobe lol in all honesty glimpses of probably lebron xxi and maybe kobe 5 can be seen this next fan had one more name to add to the list kobeslebronssabrina 2s ja 2 a simple straightforward equation which unfortunately once again hits the mark theres no denying that the details from these three iconic kicks can be found in ja 2 the prominent swoosh and distinct patterns not to mention the alluring purple colorway do not help nikes case in the least in fact another user has come up with quite a theory for such similarities all the kobe kyrie model that got scrapped getting revamped we dont have to tell you the aftermath of nike terminating their contract with dallas star guard kyrie irving for his antisemitic comments so that subtle dig was also included here advertisement article continues below this ad andrew dutton a sneaker photographer voiced a complaint that many annoyed fans of the global apparel brand would relate to nothing original coming from nike basketball rn however this last comment from an individual might leave the nike pr team confused as to whether it was complimentary or insulting or at just the fine line between the two how different are yall expecting a shoe its 20 something lebrons and 12 kobes and yall expecting a whole new silhouette and design weve never seen do the shoes look nice or not well well leave

day to you and yours msg a thats a tough one because it covers so many eras and playing styles but without regard to position i go with steve nash shai gilgeousalexander jamal murray leo rautins and jay triano im sure im missing an obvious one or two but its early in the morning as i type and ive only had coffee q hey doug now that the draft is done i assume youre preparing for all kinds of drama during the coming free trade frenzy or maybe no drama at all watching the draft we were constantly told that team x was on the board and had five minutes to submit their choice what happens if the team does not announce their selection within the allotted time do they forfeit their pick there are 30 teams in the league with 30 firstround picks but only 58 secondround picks why of the four draft picks the raptors selected do you expect all four to spend the whole year in mississauga while no one today knows how they will develop over the coming months which ones do you think are likely to spend some considerable time with the raptors philip u a i ended up typing short stories on my phone while a passenger to a family wedding friday night and that wasnt even before free agency starts this has already been busy yes if teams blow the time allotment the pick is forfeited but i cant recall it ever happening and im sure thered be a 20second warning issued to each team close to the deadline two teams phoenix and philadelphia lost their secondround picks as part of penalties for free agency misfeasance last summer i fully expect jakobe walter and jonathan mogbo to be with the raptors for the entire season maybe a game or two in the g league but thats about it jamal shead and ulrich chomche will see some g league action i bet q a bit late but i wanted to flag your insightful insider piece about the complicated personnel decisions re pascal siakam and og anunoby im as guilty as anyone in ascribing this purely to finances so thanks for the deeper perspective with 5000 other victorians i avoided the nba draft thanks to the senior womens national team and portugal with a 12person olympic roster there are some excellent canadian players who will not be going to paris perhaps a couple of remarkable teenagers will be deemed too youthful it was fun to watch coach victor lapea experiment with lineups and tactics a power forward seemed to have a brief stint at point guard not in victoria was someone who will assuredly be going bridget carleton who as they say has taken a leap in her fifth professional season best exemplified by her monster performance earlier this week in something called the commissioners cup perhaps she is more confident or her team is much better or both but she is having a terrific wnba season dare i say that the patient rebuild of the minnesota lynx supplies as good a model as any for the raptors in the next few years james a victoria a i didnt see the game thanks to the nba draft but i heard they looked good portugals not exactly a global power though and there was some experimenting going on makes sense too to find who can do what the full team 12 players and alternates is being announced tuesday it will include the four wnbaers im told and eight you saw in victoria q hi doug no nba games no nba news right ok not entirely true im sure there are lots of questions about all the new raptors additions so i wont add to the pile but i did want to ask a few other questions 1 last week you briefly mentioned that dalano banton as a member of the celtics team for the majority of the season would be eligible for a championship ring does that mean some former raptors in a similar situation have rings delon wright cj miles anyone else did jonas valanciunass injury mean he didnt play enough games to qualify 2 read a great article echoing a point that you made about zack edey and many other drafted players critics focus too much on the negatives and forget about the positive qualities of the player as a result like the 2013 draft this one was labelled as weak because of no clear frontrunners rudy gobert cant play offence giannis antetokounmpo is too raw neither jalen brunson or nikola jokic are elite athletes etc fair assessments to a degree but missed the big picture thoughts 3 do you have any idea how early nba scouts start paying attention to players obviously ncaa and prestigious high school tournaments but beyond that the odd news stories about sevenfoot tall sixth graders etc thanks for all the predraft articles i love summer league one of the earliest indicators of how well teams really drafted bernie m a teams can decide what they want to do to honour or include in celebrations anyone on the roster at any point in the championship the raptors did not give rings to valanciunas wright or miles which i understand is the norm i admit i wasnt sure edey was an nba player at the start of the season seeing him at the combine live and talking to people with teams that worked him out i became convinced he was teams start putting together dossiers on kids in the midteens through such things as the mcdonalds allstar game the nike world event and various bigticket aau tournaments q do you have a list of names that we will probably see playing in the summer league games for the raptors you mentioned in this forum a couple of months ago that grady dick was a probable still true paul m a im typing this early saturday morning before heading home from a wedding and havent got the full roster i wouldnt be surprised if we have it by the time you read this sunday i dont know about dick but my guess is hed be in vegas to workout with the group but not play in games q hi doug do you know if the raptors made an attempt to trade for josh giddey hes still so very young and i imagine he spends all summer working on his jump shot he better be working on his jump shot all summer long richard f a i am not 100 per cent sure but i be shocked if they even made a call they were always going to pay immanuel quickley as the starter and giddey would probably be an expensive backup plus im in the category of not entirely sure about how good he is doug smith is a sports reporter based

Colin Kaepernick,"Eight years on, Colin Kaepernick waits for NFL call: 'I could help win a Championship'",https://www.skysports.com/nfl/news/12118/13195418/eight-years-on-colin-kaepernick-waits-for-nfl-call-i-could-help-win-a-championship,nfl colin kaepernick believes he could still help a side win a championship in the nfl it has been eight years since he last played he helped the san francisco 49ers to their first super bowl since 1994 but has not competed since 2016 reporting from paris monday 12 august 2024 1913 uk please use chrome browser for a more accessible video player former nfl quarterback colin kaepernick believes he could help a franchise win a championship if he played in the sport again despite an eightyear absence kaepernick spent six years with the san francisco 49ers helping them to their first super bowl since 1994 during the 2012 season but has not competed in the nfl since 2016 were still training still pushing kaepernick told sky sports news so hopefully weve just got to get one of these team owners to open up its something ive trained my whole life for so to be able to step back on the field i think that would be a major moment a major accomplishment for me i think i could bring a lot to a team and help them win a championship in august 2016 and during his final season with the san francisco 49ers kaepernick began kneeling during the pregame national anthem in the nfl to protest racial injustice and police brutality taking a knee made headlines globally and still happens in sports all over the world including before certain matches during the premier league and wsl seasons at the time two days after pledging to donate 1m to community organisations kaepernick said the message is that we have a lot of issues in this country that we need to deal with latest nfl headlines and highlights stream the nfl and more with now final olympic medal table external how kaepernick first started taking a knee we have a lot of people that are oppressed we have a lot of people that arent treated equally that arent given equal opportunities kaepernick said speaking at nikes art of victory exhibition in partnership with the pompidou centre at the olympic games kaepernick said he would continue to kneel until justice is served the protests spread across the nfl in september 2016 and during the first week of the season 11 players from the west to east coast protested taking a knee also began happening in the nwsl with worldcup winning footballer megan rapinoe kneeling during a national anthem in september 2016 and saying we need to have a more thoughtful twosided conversation about racial issues in this country the then uspresident barack obama also spoke about kaepernicks actions and said hes exercising his constitutional right to make a statement i think there are a lot of ways you can do it when it comes to the flag and national anthem the nfl reports that more than 20 million people are currently playing flag football across 100 countries with the fiveversusfive version of american football a noncontact sport that is played by people of all ages the next olympic games take place in los angeles in 2028 and flag football is one of the sports set to be introduced for the first time something kaepernick would love to be a part of hopefully well be out there he said were going to work out some things see if we can make it in there would love to be out there at the paris olympics kaepernick watched usa fight back from a 13point deficit against serbia in the semifinals of the mens basketball and said it was a phenomenal game to be able to be at the usa won their fifth consecutive olympic gold medal in a thrilling game against hosts france on saturday who they beat 9887 with lebron james scoring 14 points as he won his fourth olympic medal and third gold steph curry led the way to the win scoring 24 while devin booker and kevin durant the first fourtime mens gold medallist in olympic basketball history scored 15 each hopefully they team usa continue to build on their legacy but we have some of the alltime greats on this team he said you have a lot of players who are more on the tailend of their career but also performing at levels that we just havent seen players do at their ages when you get to see competitors who compete against each other their whole career get to team up and actually play together so to be able to see the dynamic of lebron steph kd kevin durant joel embiid taytum d booker theyve got the full squad out there theyre all allstars and for me i think about how you even put a team together like these are the five that are at any given moment i dont want to be the one making that decision because everybodys so talented kaepernick was in paris running the 10km in the marathon for all in partnership with nike along with olympic champions caster semenya and mo farah the event allowed amateurs to tackle the olympic marathon course the night between the mens and womens races sky sports has officially launched and will be integrated into sky tv streaming service now

funds etfs bonds in this article nike ceo john donahoe appears to be on thin ice the former top executive of ebay who has been at the helm of nike since january 2020 is starting to lose wall streets confidence after the company capped off a lackluster fiscal year with more bad news on thursday nike warned that sales in its current quarter were expected to decline by a staggering 10 far worse than the 32 drop lseg had projected after it posted its slowest annual sales gain in 14 years excluding the covid19 pandemic the company also said it expects fiscal 2025 sales to be down midsingle digits when it previously expected them to grow the warning signs led shares to close 20 lower on friday making it the worst trading day in the companys history since its ipo in dec 1980 the plunge wiped about 28 billion off of nikes market cap bringing it to just under 114 billion from 142 billion a day earlier as wall street digested the dismal outlook from the worlds largest sportswear company at least six investment banks downgraded nikes stock analysts at morgan stanley and stifel took it a step further specifically calling the companys management into question the fy25 guide the 5th downward consensus revision in 6 quarters pushes prospects for growth inflection further into 2025 perhaps fy4q or spring 25 at the earliest asking investors to both underwrite success of not yet proven styles and look across an uncertain consumer discretionary backdrop into 2hcy24 until momentum could build again into 2hcy25 wrote stifel analyst jim duffy management credibility is severely challenged and potential for clevel regime change adds further uncertainty since donahoe took over as nikes top executive its stock is down more than 25 as of fridays close significantly underperforming both the sp 500 and the xrt the retailfocused etf which saw gains of around 67 and 66 in that time period respectively nike finance chief matt friend on thursday attributed the guidance cut to a host of factors some like softness in china and challenging foreign exchange headwinds are outside of nikes control but others are problems it squarely created under donahoes leadership the company is expecting wholesale orders to be slow as it scales new styles pulls back on classic franchises and works to repair its relationships with key retail partners after spending the last few years cutting them off in favor of a directselling strategy at the same time loyal customers who shop on nikes website are no longer springing for new pairs of air force 1s air jordan 1s or dunks the companys core franchises critics say the sneaker lines have dominated the retailers offerings for too long and turned customers away as they sought fresh styles and innovative designs from a slew of upstart competitors thats left nike to win back some of its most essential customers runners as the retailer focused on its directselling strategy at the expense of innovation scrappy competitors like on running and hoka snatched up market share it was almost silly towards the end of the call they talked about running being such a key sport that consumers are taking part in weve known that for a long time weve known that the consumer changed their mind postpandemic how theyre much more active jessica ramrez senior research analyst at jane hali associates told cnbc adding a management change at nike is quite needed postlockdown we saw that the consumer did adopt running and was serious about that and there was an everyday runner and nike didnt really respond to that she said i think when you have management missing key consumer shifts theres a problem with your company something changed and theyve missed the mark kevin mccarthy a senior research analyst at neuberger berman told cnbcs scott wapner on thursday that the company needs a change in management and speculated that donahoes employment contract could soon expire everything that youve suggested is wrong with this company seems to flow back to execution management and everything else mccarthy said on cnbcs closing bell theyve got a couple internal candidates right now that are very capable youve got a couple exnike candidates too that have been in the discussion and then you also have other competitors that have been discussed but i do think that its assumed that the leadership of this company will be changing over the next six months in fairness to donahoe the covid19 pandemic started in earnest in the us less than two months into his tenure and hes had to grapple with shuttered stores remote workers and a rollercoaster ride of shifting consumer preferences and abilities while the companys stock may be down nikes annual sales have grown some 37 under his leadership from 374 billion in fiscal 2020 to 5136 billion in fiscal 2024 if you ask phil knight nikes founder and its chairman emeritus donahoe is doing just fine i have seen nikes plans for the future and wholeheartedly believe in them the 86yearold told cnbc in a statement i am optimistic in nikes future and john donahoe has my unwavering confidence and full support got a confidential news tip we want to hear from you sign

email is sent email has already been sent please verify your email address youve reached your account maximum for followed topics unsurprisingly the los angeles lakers search for a new head coach has been nothing short of captivating jj redick leads a pool of candidates who could take the kingdoms keys as the process of hiring a new head coach progresses a recent report has shed light on what the future coaching staff could ultimately look like according to dan woike of the los angeles times the lakers met with james borrego on wednesday and were pleased with the interview latest on the lakers coaching search borrego interviewing heard he was impressive and possible assistant coach names that people have been talking about some more likely than others although los angeles is interviewing other candidates it sounds like the head coaching job is redicks to lose at this point with redick still bound to espn through the duration of the 2024 nba playoffs the hiring likely wont happen until the finals have concluded however it appears that the lakers have begun to think about potential additions to the coaching staff that include names like scott brooks and 2x nba champion rajon rondo via los angeles times rumors of the lakers staffing plans have run throughout the league during the past two weeks with some names most commonly mentioned including former head coach scott brooks and assistants sam cassell and jared dudley woike wrote exlakers guard rajon rondo has also been under consideration according to people with knowledge of the situation not authorized to speak publicly rondo began his career with the boston celtics in 2006 in the following season he became a fulltime starter as the celtics defeated the lakers in six games that june to win the world championship in 2018 he signed with the lakers and in his second season with the team he played a key role off the bench as it won it all for years rondo has been lauded by his peers for his high basketball iq and strong feel for the game perhaps he could even make a decent head coach someday after he pays his dues as an assistant first its been widely reported james will not be involved in the lakers coaching probe given james history that statement naturally draws skepticism in april rondo called it quits after 16 seasons in the nba the 61 guards ability to push the pace facilitate attack the basket and make timely plays was indispensable to las 2020 championship squad james certainly appreciated playing with him james spoke glowingly of his former teammate one of the best players i ever played with obviously his iq was out of this world i was very lucky to get to team up with him do always talked about if he ever teamed up with me he knew we could win a championship and we did that lebron james james would undoubtedly vouch for rondo to join the lakers coaching staff no 23 has often stated his affinity towards guys with a high basketball iq according to james rondo is one of the most brilliant basketball minds ever without a doubt the job of coaching james as either the head coach or assistant is extraordinarily challenging without a doubt james passiveaggressive nature can make a coachs job much harder than it needs to be without a doubt james has some blood on his hands for the way darvin hams tenure went down for some that will be enough to brand james with that coach killer moniker one of the most brutal insults you can give a professional athlete in light of this recent criticism james perhaps decided hed stay out of it altogether however it wouldnt be a stunner if james spoke privately to rondo about signing on to coach rich paul the agent of lebron james appeared to accidentally hint at james future with the lakers your changes have been saved email is sent

7 shakes hands with forward jayson tatum after a dunk during the slam dunk competition during nba all star saturday night at lucas oil stadium mandatory credit kyle teradausa today sports is jaylen browns controversy a sign of deeper issues within the team usa basketballs managing director grant hill has been caught in a wave of controversies since the olympics began it started with jaylen browns exclusion from the squad and then jayson tatum not receiving enough playing time during the olympic games even though hill said that he would consider brown in the 2028 olympic squad things have not cooled down yet team usa went to the olympics with a starstudded lineup which comprised 12 players toptier nba players yes they won the gold but it was not all sunshine and rainbows behind the scenes with that much talent not everyone got the minutes they wanted even the big names from the nba squads just look at jayson tatumhe ended up with multiple dnps as he sat out two whole games with no playing time and not everyone was happy with it in light of that veteran nba analyst brian windhorst advised grant hill to pick the young players going ahead to avoid all the drama the idea is to start developing the young players specifically for fiba competitions and to build a squad that is down to stick together through a few summers leading up to big events like the 2028 olympics i dont necessarily think its the worst idea in the world to take all young guys to the world cup like do what they do in soccer of the olympics and say we are gonna take all 23 and under windhorst mentioned on the espn podcast advertisement article continues below this ad because weteam usa are gonna start developing fiba players we are gonna say hey commit to playing in the summer in 2026 commit to playing the summer in 27 and you are not promised for 28 but lets see where it leads maybe there shouldnt be in spots 11 and 12 maybe there shouldnt be star players there maybe there should be fiba players nba players dont get me wrong but fiba players who have played for multiple summers in a row the media vet further added is jaylen browns controversy a ticking time bomb for team usa react reactions windhorst wants team usa to create a crew thats more in sync with international play after all its all about longterm growth and commitment not just banking on nba stars talking about nba stars though whats been brewing between grant hill and jaylen brown lets dive deep it was not that long ago that jaylen brown took a shot at team usa and nike letting everyone know he was not cool with team usa picking his celtics teammate derrick white as kawhi leonards replacement instead of him the current finals mvp tweeted nike this what we doing brown was probably implying it was nike that kept him off the team usa roster advertisement article continues below this ad in response hill said and so whatever theories that might be out there theyre just that but thats my responsibility and its tough its tough to have conversations tell people that theyre not on the team jaylen brown did not take too kindly to being called a conspiracy theorist by the usab managing director as he shot back stating grant hill calling me a conspiracy theorist is disappointing ive been a vp of the nbpa since i was 21 years old i have a great understanding however grant hill now wants to squash the beef he is even open to having brown on the team usa squad in the 2028 olympics its a lot of noise im confident he and i will sit down at some point and talk about it and get to some level of understanding hell be a candidate if he wants in 2028 one thing ive learned you cant take anything personally in this role i havent personalized anything my objective my goal is to win and as soon as hopefully that happens we pivot and start looking ahead to the future hill said as this might have been the last season for many of the veteran players in the olympics there will probably be space for jaylen brown on the team usa roster for the 2028 olympics but the question is after all that has happened will brown accept the offer to be a part of team usa what are your thoughts advertisement

popovich and kerr advertisement article continues below this ad along with kerr lebron james kevin durant and stephen curry the threeheaded hydra of team usa are also likely to be retiring while its true that its a tough position to fill its still vacant and by 2028 theres no doubt that jt jb and white would very well adorn the veteran badge and if the 30yearold is still a celtic team usa would in effect be a celtics powerhouse poll 1 of 4 do you think jayson tatum can lead team usa to olympic gold in 2028 absolutely no way maybe if he gets more support only if steve kerr coaches have an interesting take join debate do you think adidas should have honored noah lyles instead of anthony edwards yes no both deserve recognition neither have an interesting take join debate who do you think had the biggest influence on nick meads rowing career his father his mother his siblings his coaches have an interesting take join debate what do you think about devin booker being spotted at noah lyles event supportive teammate just a fan publicity stunt coincidence have an interesting take join debate steve kerr is likely to retire as team usa head coach which means a new lead voice for 2028 in los angeles erik spoelstra is viewed as the strong internal favorite to become team usas next in line following gregg popovich and kerr pictwittercomnjym4i8cfx evan sidery esidery august 11 2024 expand tweet among those who demanded a proper explanation from steve kerr included jayson tatums mom brandy cole and the cs owner wyc grousbeck and they went public with their criticism the head coach however has played it diplomatic across the board and he delivered on the promise of bringing the gold medal back home even though the critics couldnt say much after that as even jayson was seen sharing a broad smile with his teammates lets dive deeper and see what his mother and franchise owner had to say earlier it was only a matter of time before brandy cole would be forced to put her foot down her son just led his team to an nba title in the wake of the best record in the league he earned a spot on the allnba first team for 3 years straight and received allstar recognition for 5 years so yes mama tatum was indignant and she made sure to let kerr know of it when she replied to a tweet from espns dick vitale someone pls let me know is jaytatum0 injured as he hasnt received the pt playing time u would expect an all nba player to get vitale posted from his x account cole immediately took the chance to retweet with a dig of her own no he not but if you find out whats going on please let me know unacceptable and makes no sense if kerr thought jts mom was the only one who had some words for him think again advertisement article continues below this ad kerrs actions also stupefied bostons majority owner grousbeck appearing on the greg hill show recently he said i mean i wouldnt play steve kerr let me put it that way its a complete mystery i think jayson doesnt deserve anything but praise kudos and playing time i think he and jaylen brown led us to this unbelievable championship and theyre not apparently helping the olympic team its mystifying clearly there are a lot of people who are unhappy with steve kerr but even amid such disappointing circumstances jayson tatum has his fill of happiness the nba championship obviously but the tatum family welcomed another member after the team usa win the 2x olympian and his family posed for family portraits and who else to join them but grammy winningsinger and tatums baby mama ella mai anyway the 2028 team usa roster is going to be very interesting if not for anything else to see if grant hill makes good on his word what do you think advertisement article continues below this ad before you go do not forget to

reaction after nani cried during a defeat to liverpool in 2011 dirk kuyt scored a hattrick at anfield as the reds ran out 31 winners but the game is also still remembered for one horror tackle from liverpool legend jamie carragher on nani the winger had already gifted the reds their second goal of the afternoon inexplicably heading luis suarezs cross back into his own sixyard box for a grateful kuyt to head home but his game came to a premature end after he was stretchered off following carraghers challenge on the stroke of halftime read more liverpool face luis diaz transfer decision after

sets of players angrily confronting each other in the aftermath of the incident however that came to an end after it was spotted that nani was crying on the floor and reflecting on the incident evra has admitted the united squad were ready to kill the portuguese revealing how he ended up being given a week off training following an angry confrontation with united manager sir alex ferguson i remember when nani had a crazy challenge against jamie carragher against liverpool evra recalled on bbc radio 5 live and we start coming and fighting with the player and i remember paul scholes saw nani crying because you could see the bone and when we saw that we just said like come on guys and we left i remember ferguson at halftime when nani was at the massage table and ferguson came and he said i really hope you really broke your leg because crying at anfield this is impossible so this is to tell you the mentality we were waiting for nani the next day and ferguson had to give him one week off he said ive given him one week off because mentally he is not ready to come back but we were ready to kill him,2024-05-03T02:00:00Z,,"['patrice', 'evra', 'recalled', 'manchester', 'united',

was very emotional last month about his future the nba was a step away from finalizing the new media rights set up of 11 years worth 76 billion with espn amazon and nbc and miller was sad about inside the nba not continuing further but just when we thought tnt was out of the race reports emerged this week that the network would use its matching rights to retain the nba media rights so the pacers legend was the happiest when he heard the news on his instagram he wrote well we have a pulse now where it goes from here is above my pay grade all i know is im excited to start my 20th season in the

had a story to tell about his coworkers advertisement article continues below this ad miller reckons what makes inside the nba a great show is the fact that it is unscripted only ernie johnson has to lead the show in a direction but shaq charles kenny what i mean hes johnson just throwing lobs and theyre finishing them further reggie miller said that the show provides honest feedback to the fans and players thats probably the reason for the high ratings of the show during the nba playoffs in may tnts may 12 game 4 coverage of the series drew 56 million viewers whereas espns may 10 game 3 coverage drew 52 million watchers as per nielsen meanwhile none of the inside the nba guys have commented on the news of tnt using its matching rights maybe they are waiting for the final decision

next year that otherwise goes to the san antonio spursfrom the outside it looks like another bad move for the bulls on top of the one that sent alex caruso to oklahoma city for josh giddey the team is getting progressively worse as the offseason continues a trend that figures to continue when or if they deal zach lavine their only remaining player who has appeared in an allstar game the past three yearsfrom the inside im sure executive vice president of basketball operations artras karniovas is patting himself on the back for kickstarting a rebuild thats certain to buy him more time with chairman jerry reinsdorfkarniovas telegraphed his intentions at the end of the season and now is carrying through with his plan his last plan didnt work so well the bulls have a 491 winning percentage in his four years at the helm and only one playoff appearancekarniovas knew the bulls core would eventually be broken up but did nothing at the 24 trade deadline now hes actually breaking it up and getting next to nothing in returnin reinsdorfs mind that counts as progress remember he let rick hahn execute a rebuild after four failed seasons as the white sox general manager and watched him win two postseason games in the next six seasons before firing him last summerits mindblowing to be a chicago sports fan and see the same things happen over and over chicago bulls forward demar derozan

overwhelmed he hadnt made an allstar team since 201718 and it seemed as though his best years were in the past he basically disappeared in san antonio following a stellar career in torontobut derozan soon proved he was far from finished leading the bulls to the top of the eastern conference at the outset of his first season they had a 2711 record and were atop the east on jan 11 2022 and derozan had come up big so often that he earned his king of the fourth monikerbut the bulls season fell apart with the loss of lonzo ball two games later and they never recovered karniovas didnt get derozan or lavine any scoring help the next two offseasons and both seasons resulted in losses in the playin roundso the derozan era ended with a thud only one playoff appearance the 41 firstround loss to the milwaukee bucks in 22none of this was his fault mind you derozan continued to defy age and played almost every game in the era of load management where veterans tend to sit out the second game of

how demar derozan defined the chicago bulls during his 3year tenurederozan said all along he loved chicago and wanted to return but assuredly he knew the bulls werent interested especially after the caruso deal before the draft derozan turns 35 next month so perhaps it made perfect basketball sense for karniovas not to bring him back the threeyear 74 million deal with the kings carries some risks at his agebut derozan will now be a part of a new big three in sacramento with deaaron fox and domantas sabonis and will have a better chance at finally winning a ring than he wouldve had in chicagowhether he can help make the kings into a true contender in the west is debatable with the emergence of the young guns in minnesota and oklahoma city and a denver team that now has something to prove after being knocked out of the playoffs by the timberwolves in a game 7 loss on their home courteither way sacramento fans are already excited about the acquisition derozan received a big

up for email newsletters enewspaper trending when demar derozan talked about the chicago bulls he often talked about loveit wasnt always outright but beneath the jokes the analysis and even the frustration that affection was the most consistent undercurrent of derozans conversations the trust he built with his teammates the refusal to let a few hard weeks or months or years shake his belief that he could make something happen hereeven as resigning conversations stalled out in the final stretch of last season derozan joked that negotiating with the team was like reasoning with a spouse after a fight what do we need to do to work on this baby lets figure this thing out you want me i want youthe love never fully ran out that was clear on the court where derozan was always undeniably recklessly invested he played hurt he played tired hell he probably played too much last season derozan led the nba in playing time at the age of 34 in his threeyear stint in chicago he played more than 90 of possible gamesit wasnt enough of course not no amount of buzzerbeater heaves and 30point games could outweigh the dysfunction and disrepair of the bulls roster construction the past three years but for three years derozan lifted the bulls to be more than they were meant to bein chicago derozan got back to being himselfhe had already rebuilt his game in san antonio but it took signing in chicago to truly reestablish himself in the nba over three seasons derozan averaged 255 points while shooting 496 from the field in the process he earned backtoback allstar selections notched 12 games with 40 or more points and cemented his moniker of king in the fourth as a twotime clutch player of the year runnerupthere was a moment when it seemed like all of this was going to work out here derozans first winter in chicago was filled with hope despite all the offseason criticism derozan was clicking alongside zach lavine lonzo ball and nikola vuevi and there was nothing derozan loved more than proving doubters wrongand then 2022 came on dec 31 2021 derozan launched off one leg as the clock ran down in indianapolis slinging a 3pointer to close the year with a win over the pacers the next night derozan repeated the feat tossing in his signature pump fake before landing a dagger three from the corner in washington dc to beat the wizardsno player had ever made buzzerbeater gamewinners from behind the arc on consecutive nights it was another slice of history for derozan another highlight that belied the weaknesses that would soon send the bulls tumbling from their stature atop the eastern conferencethe impossibility of that shot in indiana one leg up the shot clock forgotten captured everything that worked about derozan with the bulls but its the image that

cummingsapafter coby white missed his own potential gamewinning buzzerbeater in february derozan didnt hesitate to teach he instructed a trainer to grab a laptop and pull up the film of the final play

could be better derozan encouraged white it would be better but draw up 100 versions of the same play and derozan would put the ball in whites hands every timethis is the aspect of derozan that the bulls will struggle the most to replicate they can find another leading scorer and put the ball in another set of hands in the fourth quarter but derozan was the heart and the rudder of this team for three yearsthe hardest part of a team getting younger is the loss of experienced gravitas derozan wasnt a huge talker but he didnt need to say much he set a standard through action this was a shared

accepting offer in mediarights deal chicago bulls nba signs 11year mediarights deal with disney nbc and amazon ending its ties with tnt after next season these are the traces that derozan will leave on this young roster the confidence he imbued into white as a leader the persistence he honed for rookies like dalen terry on the court derozan was best known for his deadly midrange jumpers and fourthquarter heroism but within the locker room derozan made a name for himself with his bulls teammates by just showing uphe drove hours to champaign to see ayo dosunmus jersey retired by illinois in the guards rookie year he invited or more accurately compelled every player under 23 to spend summers in los angeles training with him when asked about those workouts the following preseason derozan only grinned relishing memories of putting the kids through hellthe word leadership is thrown around so much in the nba vuevi told the tribune after derozans allstar selection in 2023 its not something you can decide to be you have to have it within yourself demar has earned our respect with the way hes played with his achievements the way he comports himself on the court off the court he really took the time to make sure he knew everybody and established himself as somebody we could trustthree days into 2022 derozan couldnt go homeit was an off night the bulls had beaten the orlando magic derozan dropped 29 points but he also went 7for13 from the freethrow line any hint of inaccuracy from the penalty stripe for derozan a nowcareer 841 free throw shooter was a sign of weakness he didnt care to repeatso he stayed united center workers began to strip the opposing stanchion break down the sideline seating and peel up the court to reveal the ice concealed under the hardwood for an upcoming blackhawks game and derozan stayed until he made 250 shots from the stripe until he made things rightderozan never had the chance to make things right in chicago his departure to the sacramento kings reflected a harsher truth there probably never was a chance the bulls were too broken the roster too flawed it was never going to work outbut the love was there that was never in doubt and as the bulls take their next steps the impact of derozans devotion to his team will remain on the court and in the locker room and within this young generation he shaped it wasnt always outright but beneath the jokes the analysis and even the frustration that affection was the most consistent undercurrent of derozans conversations the trust he built with his teammates the refusal to

leaning over whites shoulder as they clicked frame by frame through the play it could be better derozan encouraged white it would be better but draw up 100 versions of the same play and derozan would put the ball in whites hands every time this is the aspect of derozan that the bulls will struggle the most to replicate they can find another leading scorer and put the ball in another set of hands in the fourth quarter but derozan was the heart and the rudder of this team for three years the hardest part of a team getting younger is the loss of experienced gravitas derozan wasnt a huge talker but he didnt need to say much he set a standard through action this was a shared trait with alex caruso whose departure to oklahoma city will similarly gut the locker room of a muchneeded veteran voice these are the traces that derozan will leave on this young roster the confidence he imbued into white as a leader the persistence he honed for rookies like dalen terry on the court derozan was best known for his deadly midrange jumpers and fourthquarter heroism but within the locker room derozan made a name for himself with his bulls teammates by just showing up he drove hours to champaign to see ayo dosunmus jersey retired by illinois in the guards rookie year he invited or more accurately compelled every player under 23 to spend summers in los angeles training with him when asked about those workouts the following preseason derozan only grinned relishing memories of putting the kids through hell the word leadership is thrown around so much in the nba vuevi told the tribune after derozans allstar selection in 2023 its not something you can decide to be you have to have it within yourself demar has earned our respect with the way hes played with his achievements the way he comports himself on the court off the court he really took the time to make sure he knew everybody and established himself as somebody we could trust three days into 2022 derozan couldnt go home it was an off night the bulls had beaten the orlando magic derozan dropped 29 points but he also went 7for13 from the freethrow line any hint of inaccuracy from the penalty stripe for derozan a nowcareer 841 free throw shooter was a sign of weakness he didnt care to repeat so he stayed united center workers began to strip the opposing stanchion break down the sideline seating and peel up the court to reveal the ice concealed under the hardwood for an upcoming blackhawks game and derozan stayed until he made 250 shots from the stripe until he made things right derozan never had the chance to make things right in chicago his departure to the sacramento kings reflected a harsher truth there probably never was a chance the bulls were too broken the roster too flawed it was never going to work out but the love was there that was never in doubt and as the bulls take their next steps the impact of derozans devotion to his team will remain on the court and in the locker room and within this young generation he shaped copyright 2024 chicago tribune,2024-07-07T16:24:24Z,,"['enewspaper', 'sign', 'email', 'newsletter', 'sign', 'email', 'newsletter', 'enewspaper', 'trending', 'demar', 'derozan',

7 shakes hands with forward jayson tatum after a dunk during the slam dunk competition during nba all star saturday night at lucas oil stadium mandatory credit kyle teradausa today sports is jaylen browns controversy a sign of deeper issues within the team usa basketballs managing director grant hill has been caught in a wave of controversies since the olympics began it started with jaylen browns exclusion from the squad and then jayson tatum not receiving enough playing time during the olympic games even though hill said that he would consider brown in the 2028 olympic squad things have not cooled down yet team usa went to the olympics with a starstudded lineup which comprised 12 players toptier nba players yes they won the gold but it was not all sunshine and rainbows behind the scenes with that much talent not everyone got the minutes they wanted even the big names from the nba squads just look at jayson tatumhe ended up with multiple dnps as he sat out two whole games with no playing time and not everyone was happy with it in light of that veteran nba analyst brian windhorst advised grant hill to pick the young players going ahead to avoid all the drama the idea is to start developing the young players specifically for fiba competitions and to build a squad that is down to stick together through a few summers leading up to big events like the 2028 olympics i dont necessarily think its the worst idea in the world to take all young guys to the world cup like do what they do in soccer of the olympics and say we are gonna take all 23 and under windhorst mentioned on the espn podcast advertisement article continues below this ad because weteam usa are gonna start developing fiba players we are gonna say hey commit to playing in the summer in 2026 commit to playing the summer in 27 and you are not promised for 28 but lets see where it leads maybe there shouldnt be in spots 11 and 12 maybe there shouldnt be star players there maybe there should be fiba players nba players dont get me wrong but fiba players who have played for multiple summers in a row the media vet further added is jaylen browns controversy a ticking time bomb for team usa react reactions windhorst wants team usa to create a crew thats more in sync with international play after all its all about longterm growth and commitment not just banking on nba stars talking about nba stars though whats been brewing between grant hill and jaylen brown lets dive deep it was not that long ago that jaylen brown took a shot at team usa and nike letting everyone know he was not cool with team usa picking his celtics teammate derrick white as kawhi leonards replacement instead of him the current finals mvp tweeted nike this what we doing brown was probably implying it was nike that kept him off the team usa roster advertisement article continues below this ad in response hill said and so whatever theories that might be out there theyre just that but thats my responsibility

and its tough its tough to have conversations tell people that theyre not on the team jaylen brown did not take too kindly to being called a conspiracy theorist by the usab managing director as he shot back stating grant hill calling me a conspiracy theorist is disappointing ive been a vp of the nbpa since i was 21 years old i have a great understanding however grant hill now wants to squash the beef he is even open to having brown on the team usa squad in the 2028 olympics its a lot of noise im confident he and i will sit down at some point and talk about it and get to some level of understanding hell be a candidate if he wants in 2028 one thing ive learned you cant take anything personally in this role i havent personalized anything my objective my goal is to win and as soon as hopefully that happens we pivot and start looking ahead to the future hill said as this might have been the last season for many of the veteran players in the olympics there will probably be space for jaylen brown on the team usa roster for the 2028 olympics but the question is after all that has happened will brown accept the offer to be a part of team usa what are your thoughts advertisement

nikewhos in the wrong here share your thoughts from appearance alone there are no reservations when looking at the adorned team usa olympic team packed with the best of the league youngsters and veterans there is no weakness however a major point of discussion was the exclusion of jaylen brown as the reigning finals mvp brown felt sour about being excluded even blaming nike but with three other celtics teammates on the roster did the organization make an effort to push his case recently celtics president brad stevens spoke to the boston globe about the entire situation having seen browns dexterity for years stevens had no doubt over his capabilities but at the same time the former head coach of the celtics isnt one to meddle in the process although he did put in a good word i just tell everybody how great our guys are and then i stay out of it i think thats my role i think jaylen could be on any olympic team any given year he could be a featured part of those teams i saw usa basketball director grant hill said hed love to sit down and talk to him about being part of that pool in 28 whatever that may be stevens told the boston globe advertisement article continues

sports poll 1 of 4 do you think brad stevens should intervene in jaylen browns feud with nike yes its his responsibility no its a personal matter only if it affects the team not sure have an interesting take join debate do you think lebron james dream of owning an nba team in las vegas will come true absolutely no way maybe but not soon only if he partners with someone have an interesting take join debate do you think frances victor wembanyama can derail team usas gold medal dreams absolutely no way maybe but its unlikely only if team usa underperforms have an interesting take join debate do you agree with steve kerrs decision to bench jayson tatum absolutely not at all depends on the situation im not sure have an interesting take join debate it was during all the smokes open run that hill told rachel nichols that he would be open to welcoming jaylen brown on the 2028 olympics team when the competition will take place in los angeles additionally grant also previously revealed his having a conversation with browns agent and explaining it was really truly a basketball decision jaylen brown though seems unconvinced and has proclaimed to speak more indepth about his exclusion at a later time while it isnt a pleasant situation stevens feels the 27yearold will return with a vengeance even before the paris olympics saga jaylen brown was among the best combo guards in the entire league his fervor during the postseason showed flashes of his true potential as he improved as a defender and became the focal attack point his diligent efforts were rewarded with mvps in both the ecf and the nba finals advertisement article continues below this ad but is there another level to his basketball gifts stevens feels the olympics snub will motivate jaylen brown to evolve his game a step further but i think jaylen is one of the best players in the world and one of the best things about jaylen is whether he gets the call and makes the team or doesnt get the call hes going to use it as motivation to get better so i know hes working and hes excited about improving i think hell truly embrace the challenges that come with winning last year thats who hes always been and this will probably add more fuel to his fire but he doesnt need much fuel added he finds it stevens said the nba landscape has changed drastically in the months since the celtics claimed their 18th title teams such as the new york knicks and philadelphia 76ers have made major trades in the offseason similar to the west the east is no longer a onesided conference the celtics will face much severe competition not only due to the improved teams but also their status as the current champions advertisement article continues below this ad and its never easy to repeat at the same time the celtics are looking to begin a dynasty spearheaded by jaylen brown and jayson tatum with the sweet taste of victory the prolific duo is not one to let the competition steal whats theirs nor are the

Jaylen Brown,USA Basketball: Grant Hill says Jaylen Brown will be considered for 2028 Olympics after omission in Paris,https://www.cbssports.com/olympics/news/usa-basketball-grant-hill-says-jaylen-brown-will-be-considered-for-2028-olympics-after-omission-in-paris/,if not listed please contact your tv provider usa basketball director grant hill hopes to clear the air with boston celtics forward jaylen brown brown took issue with not being selected as a replacement on the 2024 paris olympics roster after kawhi leonard withdrew from the team team usa elected to choose browns celtics teammate derrick white for the open roster spot leading to brown calling out usa basketball and nike the official apparel brand for team usa brown implied on social media that nike was the reason he was kept off the team to which hill responded at the time saying in part whatever theories that might be out there theyre just that but thats my responsibility and its tough its tough to have conversations tell people that theyre not on the team brown then shot back on social media calling out hill saying grant hill calling me a conspiracy theorist is disappointing ive been a vp of the nbpa since i was 21 years old i have a great understanding while the dust had settled on the situation since the olympics started hill said on the open run podcast with rachel nichols that he hopes to talk with brown and that he will be considered for the 2028 los angeles olympics when you have a team with the profile of players on this team you know theres going to be controversy you know that coming in i knew that i think what people fail to realize is im a fan of basketball and im a fan of these guys that are playing in the current eramy whole approach is to celebrate the greatness of todays players so yeah it was disappointing you gotta do your job ive tried to do this the right way when we first put out the roster back in april before it was announced i called certain guys i called paul george damian lillard jaylen brown i felt like they were of a certain stature where they deserved to hear it before it was made public and i appreciated their willingness to want to be a part of this but also wanted them to appreciate just how difficult this was to me that was leading with integrity doing the right thing recognizing who they are what theyve meant to usa basketball in years past its a lot of noise im confident he and i will sit down at some point and talk about it and get to some level of understanding hell be a candidate if he wants in 2028 one thing ive learned you cant take anything personal in this role i havent personalized anything my objective my goal is to win and as soon as hopefully that happen we pivot and start looking ahead to the future brown certainly has the resume to make the usa basketball roster especially after this season during which he finished as an nba champion and finals mvp while leading the celtics throughout the postseason to their first title since 2008 but making the roster for usa basketball is the most difficult team to make given all the talent you could argue that he shouldve been named the replacement over white but there were very good reasons to have white on the roster over brown too while team usa looks on pace to earn its fifth straight gold medal the 2028 olympics will be a total change of guard for the mens basketball team lebron james could be retired and kevin durant and stephen curry will be 39 and 40 years old respectively so naturally there will be more room for brown to be on the roster hill sounds more than ready to bury the hatchet well just have to see if brown is willing to do the same 20042024 cbs interactive all

Jaylen Brown,USA Basketball: Grant Hill says Jaylen Brown will be considered for 2028 Olympics after omission in Paris,https://www.cbssports.com/olympics/news/usa-basketball-grant-hill-says-jaylen-brown-will-be-considered-for-2028-olympics-after-omission-in-paris/,if not listed please contact your tv provider usa basketball director grant hill hopes to clear the air with boston celtics forward jaylen brown brown took issue with not being selected as a replacement on the 2024 paris olympics roster after kawhi leonard withdrew from the team team usa elected to choose browns celtics teammate derrick white for the open roster spot leading to brown calling out usa basketball and nike the official apparel brand for team usa brown implied on social media that nike was the reason he was kept off the team to which hill responded at the time saying in part whatever theories that might be out there theyre just that but thats my responsibility and its tough its tough to have conversations tell people that theyre not on the team brown then shot back on social media calling out hill saying grant hill calling me a conspiracy theorist is disappointing ive been a vp of the nbpa since i was 21 years old i have a great understanding while the dust had settled on the situation since the olympics started hill said on the open run podcast with rachel nichols that he hopes to talk with brown and that he will be considered for the 2028 los angeles olympics when you have a team with the profile of players on this team you know theres going to be controversy you know that coming in i knew that i think what people fail to realize is im a fan of basketball and im a fan of these guys that are playing in the current eramy whole approach is to celebrate the greatness of todays players so yeah it was disappointing you gotta do your job ive tried to do this the right way when we first put out the roster back in april before it was announced i called certain guys i called paul george damian lillard jaylen brown i felt like they were of a certain stature where they deserved to hear it before it was made public and i appreciated their willingness to want to be a part of this but also wanted them to appreciate just how difficult this was to me that was leading with integrity doing the right thing recognizing who they are what theyve meant to usa basketball in years past its a lot of noise im confident he and i will sit down at some point and talk about it and get to some level of understanding hell be a candidate if he wants in 2028 one thing ive learned you cant take anything personal in this role i havent personalized anything my objective my goal is to win and as soon as hopefully that happen we pivot and start looking ahead to the future brown certainly has the resume to make the usa basketball roster especially after this season during which he finished as an nba champion and finals mvp while leading the celtics throughout the postseason to their first title since 2008 but making the roster for usa basketball is the most difficult team to make given all the talent you could argue that he shouldve been named the replacement over white but there were very good reasons to have white on the roster over brown too while team usa looks on pace to earn its fifth straight gold medal the 2028 olympics will be a total change of guard for the mens basketball team lebron james could be retired and kevin durant and stephen curry will be 39 and 40 years old respectively so naturally there will be more room for brown to be on the roster hill sounds more than ready to bury the hatchet well just have to see if brown is willing to do the same 20042024 cbs interactive all

LaMarcus Aldridge,LaMarcus Aldridge retires as one of his generation's unluckiest and most underappreciated NBA superstars,https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/lamarcus-aldridge-retires-as-one-of-his-generations-unluckiest-and-most-underappreciated-nba-superstars/,if not listed please contact your tv provider an undercurrent of disrespect permeated lamarcus aldridges 2015 free agency for a week that july he was the center of the nba universe the lone championshipaltering force on a market accustomed to players just a hair greater aldridge was never lebron james or kevin durant but for that one week he was treated like it and it was a feeling he seemingly wanted to replicate in perpetuity despite winning 105 games in his last two seasons in portland reports indicated that his desire to compete for championships was matched or perhaps exceeded by his longing for validation adrian wojnarowski even reported at the time that aldridge loathed driving around portland and seeing the many billboards adidas had posted featuring teammate damian lillard free agency was an opportunity to win but more importantly it was an opportunity to do so on his own terms its something aldridge who announced his retirement for the second time on friday never really got to do in 16 nba seasons he started his career as the third wheel to a preordained brandon roygreg oden dynasty and by the time injuries ruined it lillards ascent rendered him a sidekick on the only team hed ever known the egalitarian theory of the spurs offered an alternative that kawhi leonards brilliance swallowed in practice aldridge asked for a trade after his second season in san antonio and rescinded it only after leonards injury granted him the spotlight he so craved but never quite deserved the aldridgeled spurs were good they made the playoffs but without a leonardcaliber leading man aldridge was never going to win a championship it makes his career an interesting case study in compromise sidekicking is notoriously tedious stars routinely grumble about the sacrifices it takes to win alongside superior teammates but aldridge never got the chance he reached the conference finals only once and by the time he was willing to sacrifice enough of the trappings of stardom to reach the absolute highest levels of winning it was too late aldridge played only five games on the contending 202021 nets before a heart condition ended his season he played 47 more games for the nets in 202122 but the team fell way short of expectations it was the least satisfying possible outcome for aldridges career he never held the keys to a franchise as lillard does now nor did he have the chance to ride shotgun on the way to someone elses championship it was ultimately a case of poor luck on both fronts and it dates back to the very beginning of his career the toronto raptors held the no 1 overall pick in the 2006 nba draft and despite the pleas of fellow texan chris bosh opted for andrea bargnani as their top choice that robbed aldridge of an ideal longterm frontcourt partner a modern mismatch machine of a duo that would have drawn opposing bigs out of the paint a full decade before they were ready to one pick later the chicago bulls drafted him at no 2 and for a moment the chance to serve as michael jordans longawaited successor could have made aldridge one of the leagues brightest young stars that picks original owner offered similar marketability had they not traded for eddy curry aldridge may well have begun his career as the face of the new york knicks but big market fame eluded him after a trade to portland that should have earned him some jewelry injuries to oden and roy and then leonard in san antonio only scratch the surface of why it didnt the 201314 blazers started the season 319 before injuries to aldridge cost them a possible 60win season a year later portland trailed only the nascent warriors in the western conference standings when wes matthews tore his achilles and knocked the blazers out of championship contention neither was aldridges best team though that honor belongs to the historically overlooked 2016 spurs fun fact the 73win warriors of 2016 didnt have the nbas best point differential san antonios plus111 net rating outpaced golden states plus106 the spurs had the nbas no 4ranked offense and best overall defense but ran into a durantshaped buzzsaw in the second round of the postseason durants warriors knocked aldridge and the spurs out of the postseason again a year later when leonard landed on zaza pachulias foot in what would have been a game 1 rout just like that aldridges title hopes were dashed his loss ironically was the gain of one of his draftmates kyle lowry also had a brief window to contend with leonard but when that very raptors team that didnt draft aldridge ran into durant in 2019 the player that deprived aldridge of his title was injured lowry will forever be remembered as a champion based on that run and justifiably so but he benefited from circumstances that deprived aldridge of the same privilege by most traditional measures of individual successpoints allstar appearances allnba nods career earningshis career was superior it wont be remembered quite as fondly without that feather in his cap its no wonder aldridge was so imageconscious in 2015 portland couldnt give him a championship but it couldnt give him what it gave lillard either it makes legislating his legacy a somewhat complicated affair aldridge fits in no defined box and his career has no identifiable arc he was a constant never changing a midrange shooting style that carried him from evolutionary to anachronism across a changing league for over a decade he flirted with the traditional benchmark of big man stardomthe coveted 20 and 10 status symbol that has long since gone out of fashionyet between 2008 and 2018 his scoring never deviated by more than six points per game he just kept chugging along putting up allstar caliber numbers on teams only locals and league pass junkies ever watched it irked aldridge enough to take matters into his own hands he asked for trades in 2013 and 2017 and used free agency to change teams in 2015 always looking for something slightly different perhaps sensing the end was near he used a recent buyout to take one last swing at the championship that eluded him but in the grand scheme of his career it seems appropriate that he wont end up winning one not because he isnt deserving but because without one the discourse will have to meet him on his terms remembering lamarcus aldridge means reckoning with an often unsatisfying career but an enormously successful one regardless those unkind circumstances can enforce a somewhat more honest conversation about who aldridge was as a player there is no easy narrative no legendary team or mindboggling statistic to condense his contributions into he wont be on billboards now that his career is over he was just a great player whose talent was narrowly beaten out by his poor luck that luck robbed him of the attention his talent warranted during his career with some distance its praise he more than deserves in retirement 20042024 cbs interactive all rights reserved cbs sports is a registered trademark of cbs

Scottie Pippen,Everything You Need to Know About the Pippen Children,https://www.essentiallysports.com/nba-legends-basketball-news-meet-scottie-pippens-seven-kids-everything-you-need-to-know-about-the-pippen-children/,more sports es fancast aug 12 2024 859 am edt via getty miami fl february 04 scottie pippen attends market america conference 2016 at american airlines arena on february 4 2016 in miami florida photo by aaron davidsongetty images via getty miami fl february 04 scottie pippen attends market america conference 2016 at american airlines arena on february 4 2016 in miami florida photo by aaron davidsongetty images scottie pippens kids are thrivingdo you think theyll follow in his legendary footsteps scotty pippen jr often makes it to the headlines but the other kids of the exbulls star not so much many basketball enthusiasts would still know of pips 4 children with larsa however not much is reported about the other three children that the 6x nba champ had before them notably these three children come from three different exes of scottie pippen karen mccollum sonya roby and yvette deleone lets have a closer look at not just pips 7 children but also at what they have been up to and what kind of bond do they share with their father advertisement article continues below this ad the fans of the 7x allstar would know that long before larsa pippen was married to karen mccollum and it was with his first wife that he welcomed his firstborn antron into this world in december 1987 growing up in lawrenceville he played basketball for south georgia technical college and later for the world basketball association in 2013 if one is to believe scottie his son was a late bloomer but still better than him in high school poll 1 of 4 which of scottie pippens seven kids do you think will make the biggest impact in sports antron pippen scotty pippen jr preston pippen sierra pippen justin pippen sophia pippen taylor pippen have an interesting take join debate who do you think handled the anthony edwards and adidas controversy better anthony edwards adidas noah lyles usain bolt have an interesting take join debate do you think dennis rodman was a good father to alexis yes no its complicated not sure have an interesting take join debate which of devin bookers rumored relationships surprised you the most kendall jenner jordyn woods christina nadin hannah harrison have an interesting take join debate but before we could see more of antrons basketball talents on the big stage he passed away at 33 although pip never revealed the exact cause of death he shared in an ig post that his son suffered from chronic asthma he never let that get him down though antron stayed positive and worked hard and i am so proud of the man that he became read the post this was the 6x nba champs only child with his first wife a post shared by scottie pippen scottiepippen his second child came into this world in july 1994 with his exgirlfriend sonya roby the fact he did not want to accept the parental responsibility of his first daughter may surprise some fans as per the information by the associated press he accepted taylor pippen as his daughter only after a dna test disapproved of his denial following this scottie pippen agreed to provide financial support while roby retained the full custody of her daughter but it turns out his relationship with his eldest daughter remained limited to this arrangement itself i know that people expect a lot from me but after all these years i have learned that pippen is just that a last name taylor said in an interview but her development into an accomplished athlete proves that the apple doesnt fall from the tree no matter what not only did taylor play volleyball for southern illinois university but went pro in spain for one season in 2016 by 2024 she became the vice president of commercial banking at jp morgan chase co notably taylor also had a twin sister named tyler but she died soon after her birth at the hospital itself as for pips last child before marrying larsa he had yet again denied being the father after a paternity suit by his exgirlfriend yvette deleone the court revealed scottie to be the father of sierra pippen the exbulls star eventually reached a

Ndamukong Suh,"I played with Tom Brady, beat Patrick Mahomes to Super Bowl and learned to embrace 'hated' tag from Nike billionaire",https://talksport.com/sport/1607565/ndamukong-suh-tom-brady-super-bowl-mahomes-phil-knight/,ndamukong suh was tom bradys super bowlwinning teammate received critical life advice from nike cofounder phil knight and was once best known as the most hated player in the nfl now that suh is entering the media world while still searching for an ideal playing situation like he found last season with the philadelphia eagles one of the best defenders during the last two decades is opening up and revealing the real man behind the facemask i did everything that it took and played right to the edge suh exclusively told talksport for me youre not supposed to like me and im not doing my job if you do like me suh who was again linked with the miami dolphins after bradley chubbs injury was open honest and at ease during the interview in london where hes been living for the last month while working as an nfl analyst for sky sports the fivetime pro bowler with 600 career tackles 715 sacks and three super bowl appearances also wasnt afraid to say what he really thinks which wasnt the case during his early playing days when he realized hed been painted as a classic nfl bad guy i started to learn man the media need to have hot stories and they need to have people to talk about he said they also need to have the pretty boy in tom brady the all star in peyton manning and youve got to have the villain i was one of those villains that fit in perfectly just from that standpoint i started to embrace those things and i really learned that from phil knight mentioning brady soon had suh reflecting on tampa bays 2020 season which initially was filled with drama and question marks but ended with a dominant 319 victory over patrick mahomes and the kansas city chiefs in super bowl lv brady was a great teammate suh said the greatest quarterback of all time also put in the necessary work and knew how to get the best out of his teammates i see why hes so good just because of his work ethic and the things that he builds himself off and that mindset and focus suh said but as a true champion and this is what i learned earlier on in my career in probably my second and third year youre only as good as the people around you if theyre not bought into how you work and you cant make them better you will not move far the 13year veteran remembers a challenging midseason conversation within the buccaneers in 2020 that changed tampa bays year and pointed bruce arians team toward the top of the world guys look how talented we are and were playing at such an average level suh recalled its not because of our talent its because we havent come together as a unit and stopped being selfish arians was the perfect sideline leader for those bucs and rivals jim caldwell as the best coach that suh has played for bruce is like you guys want to win its on you like im going to give you everything suh said im going to listen to you you guys want to change things you want to run practice differently you want to do it this way do it that way well do it but at the end of the day you have ownership in this the 2010 defensive rookie of the year took arians advice to heart when tampa bay had two weeks to prepare for the big game against mahomes and the chiefs suh said that he told thendefensive coordinator todd bowles that a normal blitzheavy scheme needed to be tweaked to take down a kansas city offense that would attack the bucs secondary well attack with this front seven and trust me we will get there suh said we just ate that offensive line and their offense alive because we had that confidence and we knew what we were going to do and we were all on the same page and we believed last year suh believed that he had his second world championship wrapped up philadelphia led mahomes team 2414 at halftime with jalen hurts outplaying the biggest chief and the eagles just 30 minutes away from a shining trophy all we needed to do was on the defensive side of the ball because offense was lights out the entire time just take care of our responsibility suh said and i feel in some cases we got outcoached and outplayed in the second half of that game and obviously that led to us losing the match those emotions going through that having lost my first super bowl and then winning my second super bowl to be able to have an opportunity and be in that position to where youre like 30 minutes away from being a super bowl champion for the second time that really stung suh would have retired after the 2022 season if the eagles had won it all instead one of the games fiercest defenders relied on his young children to help him get through the pain of losing another game on the nfls biggest stage if we had won i would have probably been done suh said walk away being a champion and then ride off into the sunset and see what the media world had for me he added the only thing that really probably got me through that was knowing im coming home to my kids they dont know a difference theyre barely 2 theyre just excited a twogame suspension in 2011 for stomping on a green bay packers player ended up being a life changer for suh thanks to a private conversation with knight i went home to oregon and phil knight asked me to come meet him in his office at nike where i trained every offseason even to this day suh said and we just had an amazing hour hour and a half conversation and he just laid it out to me suh became more in control of his playing style career focus and overall image twelve years later hes waiting on one more nfl call while exploring the media world after winning a super bowl with brady and spending more than a decade as one of the leagues biggest villains suh believes that his powerful career should end up in canton ohio i dont regret anything suh said i love every moment of my career and hopefully that will surmount to me being a hall of fame player once i do decide to retire this service is provided on

Steve Kerr,"Will Jayson Tatum Lead the Charge in 2028 Olympics? Steve Kerr Decision Could Make Team USA a Boston Celtics Powerhouse, Here's How",https://www.essentiallysports.com/nba-active-basketball-news-will-jayson-tatum-lead-the-charge-in-two-thousand-twenty-eight-olympics-steve-kerr-decision-could-make-team-usa-a-boston-celtics-powerhouse-here-s-how/,more sports es fancast aug 11 2024 757 pm edt can jayson tatum turn team usa into a celticsdominated powerhouse in the 2028 olympics the announcement of the 2024 olympics roster drew criticism from many with the kind of talent available in the nba and the no of players willing to play disagreements were more than bound to happen but soon another controversy pretty much rocked the olympic boat steve kerr deciding not to play jayson tatum in the tournament opener really ruffled serious feathers but then again taking a look at the whole team usa campaign kerr has been at the receiving end of the short stick for his player combinations come 2028 when the next round of the olympics rolls up it seems like the usa basketball board could very well turn into a celtics powerhouse for one choosing derrick white over 2024 finals mvp jaylen brown after kawhi leonard withdrew his candidature had put managing director grant hill in the spotlightand not the good kind at the time hill calmed the crowd with a promise if brown was willing hed have a place in the 2028 olympic roster and for all the tatum fans this new evan sidery update on x would also prove to be quite a relief steve kerr is likely to retire as team usa head coach which means a new lead voice for 2028 in los angeles erik spoelstra is viewed as the strong internal favorite to become team usas next in line following gregg popovich and kerr advertisement article continues below this ad along with kerr lebron james kevin durant and stephen curry the threeheaded hydra of team usa are also likely to be retiring while its true that its a tough position to fill its still vacant and by 2028 theres no doubt that jt jb and white would very well adorn the veteran badge and if the 30yearold is still a celtic team usa would in effect be a celtics powerhouse poll 1 of 4 do you think jayson tatum can lead team usa to olympic gold in 2028 absolutely no way maybe if he gets more support only if steve kerr coaches have an interesting take join debate do you think adidas should have honored noah lyles instead of anthony edwards yes no both deserve recognition neither have an interesting take join debate who do you think had the biggest influence on nick meads rowing career his father his mother his siblings his coaches have an interesting take join debate what do you think about devin booker being spotted at noah lyles event supportive teammate just a fan publicity stunt coincidence have an interesting take join debate steve kerr is likely to retire as team usa head coach which means a new lead voice for 2028 in los angeles erik spoelstra is viewed as the strong internal favorite to become team usas next in line following gregg popovich and kerr pictwittercomnjym4i8cfx evan sidery esidery august 11 2024 expand tweet among those who demanded a proper explanation from steve kerr included jayson tatums mom brandy cole and the cs owner wyc grousbeck and they went public with their criticism the head coach however has played it diplomatic across the board and he delivered on the promise of bringing the gold medal back home even though the critics couldnt say much after that as even jayson was seen sharing a broad smile with his teammates lets dive deeper and see what his mother and franchise owner had to say earlier it was only a matter of time before brandy cole would be forced to put her foot down her son just led his team to an nba title in the wake of the best record in the league he earned a spot on the allnba first team for 3 years straight and received allstar recognition for 5 years so yes mama tatum was indignant and she made sure to let kerr know of it when she replied to a tweet from espns dick vitale someone pls let me know is jaytatum0 injured as he hasnt received the pt playing time u would expect an all nba player to get vitale posted from his x account cole immediately took the chance to retweet with a dig of her own no he not but if you find out whats going on please let me know unacceptable and makes no sense if kerr thought jts mom was the only one who had some words for him think again advertisement article continues below this ad kerrs actions also stupefied bostons majority owner grousbeck appearing on the greg hill show recently he said i mean i wouldnt play steve kerr let me put it that way its a complete mystery i think jayson doesnt deserve anything but praise kudos and playing time i think he and jaylen brown led us to this unbelievable championship and theyre not apparently helping the olympic team its mystifying clearly there are a lot of people who are unhappy with steve kerr but even amid such disappointing circumstances jayson tatum has his fill of happiness the nba championship obviously but the tatum family welcomed another member after the team usa win the 2x olympian and his family posed for family portraits and who else to join them but grammy winningsinger and tatums baby mama ella mai anyway the 2028 team usa roster is going to be very interesting if not for anything else to see if grant hill makes good on his word what do you think advertisement article continues below this ad before you go do not forget to

Enes Freedom,Ex NBA star Enes Kanter has $500K Turkish bounty on his head,https://nypost.com/2023/01/12/ex-nba-star-enes-kanter-has-500k-turkish-bounty-on-his-head/,former nba star enes kanter freedom who famously amended his name after becoming a us citizen in 2021 is officially a wanted man not only is his name on 2023s mostwanted terrorists list but this is the first time his former country has actually placed a published bounty on peoples heads president recep tayyip erdoans government is offering up to 10 million turkish lira or roughly 500000 for information leading to the capture of freedom who said he found out about it a week ago that makes it so dangerous freedom 30 told the post before the bounty turkish intelligence were after the people on the list but now everyone is after them because they want the money he also revealed that he is looking into suing the nba im waiting for the right time which freedom claims has blackballed him for his public protests against china during 11 seasons in the nba freedom was known for his outspokenness including against the turkish governments human rights abuses he has called out erdoan for being a dictator stepped on a photo of him at a protest and even dubbed him the hitler of our century because of my platform whenever i say something it goes everywhere and the turkish government hates that freedom said theyre really sick of it and they said enough is enough and are doing whatever they can to shut me up the athletes name appears on the turkish terrorist wanted list along with actual terrorists and fellow dissidents critical of the erdoan regime which has routinely defied international human rights law the list also names more than a dozen journalists part of a larger assault on the free press in turkey where the number of jailed journalists has doubled in the past year although freedom who now lives in washington dc admitted the bounty ups his personal security concerns he said is in constant contact with local law enforcement and the fbi im being protected 247 he said adding that he is more worried for the safety of the lesserknown turkish dissidents on erdoans list im speaking out because i am not the only one on that list freedom said of the bounty there are so many journalists so many activists and so many athletes but they arent as wellknown as me they are way easier targets and theyre alone out there the swissborn turkishraised american citizen has played for the new york knicks the boston celtics and other teams during his time in the nba but he caused a rift in the league which pulls in billions of dollars in revenue from china via nearly half a billion viewers when he became an outspoken critic of xi jinping and the chinese communist party hes also been critical of nike a major nba advertiser and player sponsor for its manufacturing deals in china freedom became known for wearing sneakers with messages like free tibet free uyghur and no beijing 2022 painted by dissident artists during games and has said he was pressured by the league to take off his shoes and keep his mouth shut his refusal to do so led to a tiff with nba star lebron james in 2019 i tweeted that hong kong should be free then le bron said he is not educated enough about the situation to comment on it and that what i tweeted hurt the league freedom told the post in 2021 its sad that these players are social justice warriors but when it comes to china they are scared to say anything your values are more important than any money you can ever make from china now freedom says hes been blackballed by the nba after being traded to the houston rockets from the boston celtics in february he was quickly dropped he averaged 117 minutes 37 points and 46 rebounds last season the nba is never going to admit it but i believe im being blackballed he told the post ive had many conversations and everyone is saying the same thing your career has ended because of your china comments now freedom is waiting for the right time to sue the league they are a 100 american made organization but they are being controlled and run by the biggest dictatorship in the world china he said how can china fire an american citizen from an american organization that is unacceptable the league office has had no involvement in team roster decisions involving mr freedom nba spokesman mike bass told the post nba commissioner adam silver speaking with the new york times this past march denied that kanter is being blackballed we spoke directly about his activities this season silver said at the time and i made it absolutely clear to him that it was completely within his right to speak out on issues that he was passionate about since leaving the nba he is running interfaith basketball camps for children to foster unity and has been traveling the world to meet with leaders as a human rights activist although 2023 is the first year freedom appeared on the terrorist wanted list his conflict with the turkish government is ongoing leaders revoked his passport in 2017 and requested an interpol red notice asking law enforcement worldwide to arrest pending extradition in 2019 his father mehmet was jailed in turkey and the family was forced to disown freedom for their own safety the athlete said its been nearly 10 years since he spoke to themand yet they are still being harassed back in turkey according to freedom my dad went to a market and people spit on his face he said and my mom cant walk outside freely because she gets harassed freedom said he hopes to call attention to the turkish governments cruelty i really want to show the world what kind of person erdoan is western leaders are not doing enough theyre playing softball with this dictatorship freedom said diplomacy is

Zion Williamson,"Cooper Flagg might be great at Duke, but the best part for college hoops is A.J. Dybantsa could be even better",https://www.cbssports.com/college-basketball/news/cooper-flagg-might-be-great-at-duke-but-the-best-part-for-college-hoops-is-a-j-dybantsa-could-be-even-better/,if not listed please contact your tv provider north augusta sc i remember coming to this gym the past two years and realizing that this rumoredabout kid from middleofnowhere maine was not only the real deal on the court but had the potential to become one of the cooler stories weve seen in basketball in the past 20 years cooper flagg of course and if youve been following basketball in general over the past few weeks you realize that flaggs time has officially come months before he plays a game for duke while chatting in chilly gyms in recent days at the nike peach jam i remembered how much of flaggs origin story came from the courts here at the riverview park activities center where nikes held its annual championship basketball event for close to 30 years before flagg became the latest next big thing he was a rising fascination in high school circles hes since morphed from fascination to sensation who knows what awaits him in the next nine months at duke nevertheless college basketball has a bona fide star regardless of not yet having played a division i game the buildup for that media sensationalism some of it clickbait but a lot of justified due to flaggs obvious ability and potential begins at this level at these events hell be a freshman that matters in a way nobody has since another dukie zion williamson the best freshman in the country last season was reed sheppard who was no doubt adored by kentucky fans and a wellknown talent but he also only started five games because of john caliparis stubbornness even as the national freshman of the year sheppard was somehow a kentucky oneanddonertopthree nba pick who nonetheless couldnt break through to widespread national appeal flagg will so why am i bringing up flagg in a july recruiting column when hes no longer in high school because i just spent five days on the road talking to dozens of college coaches and nba scouts and heres the most exciting part for as awesome as flagg couldshould be theres a chance he wont even be the best freshman in college basketball over the next two seasons by the end of the 202627 season he might not even be the second or thirdbest thats a great thing for the sport the future is bright particularly since g league ignite is no longer around to lure away a handful of toprated prospects annually college basketball doesnt need freshman stars in order to bring in big viewership but boy do they help and sports fans love something fresh and new i point you to none other than paul skenes in mlb mens college basketball in a doubleedged sword kind of way is unique in how its boosted off star players who arrive with a blast and leave after just one year no other sport is afflicted with this bittersweet arrangement but at least theyre getting them and folks after spending some time on the road to see the next wave of players set to enter college basketball in 2025 and 2026 it sure seems like the next few years could be something special the biggest name of them all is the highestrated player in high school a rising senior named aj dybantsa the 6foot9 shooting guardpower wing is from massachusetts plays for the oakland soldiers on the nike circuit and would appear to be one of the most gifted scorers to emerge from the prep ranks in the past 10plus years flagg was regarded as one of the best prospects to come out of high school in a generation dybantsa might be better thats not merely my projection i spent five days in rock hill south carolina and north augusta and took in adidas 3ssb threestripe select basketball championship event in addition to the peach jam i informally polled about two dozen coaches and scouts at the adidas and nike events about which prospect they liked best flagg dybantsa or another irresistible talent 2026 bluechipper tyran stokes all three being no 1 in their respective classes dybantsa received more votes than flagg and stokes combined dybantsa and stokes are playing together this week at peach jam with the oakland soldiers providing a teamup so dominant a championship run would land as no surprise heres an early glimpse of what theyve done in north augusta aj dybantsa and tyran stokes combine for 46 in a 23point win to open up peach jamstokes 25 pts 11 reb 5 astdybantsa 21 pts 1018 fg pictwittercomjk4cbqseav dybantsas scoring ability is outrageous its natural to wince at big statements made about teenagers but heres the reality of what i heard at peach jam over the weekend from multiple evaluators dybantsas offensive impact on the court at this level at this stage of his budding basketball career is akin to basically any of the best prospects to come through the ranks over the past 20 years hes that good he communicates with his teammates on basically every possession has gogogadget limbs loves the midrange just as much as the 3 and is efficient at both and seems to have the ability to teleport from one spot to another in a flash im just a loud person dybantsa told me if theres one adjective to describe dybantsas game loud feels as fitting a descriptor as any he has a preternatural ability to affect every play his presence is everpresent he looks biggerrangier than any 69 high school player ive seen if he keeps on this path hell be the no 1 pick in the 2026 draft nba scouts i talked to framed his potential in a bestcase scenario as being a guy who will one day lead the nba in scoring were still 16 months away from dybantsa playing in a college uniform but yes in case you were even a little skeptical he will be a college basketball player he is definitely going to college his father ace told me so weve got that coming in college basketball in 202526 which is electrifying as for where well see dybantsa play next year he said a trimmed list of five to seven schools will be publicized by the end of the month as of now the list of hopeful schools is more than a dozen long including almost all the blue blood names youd expect to be in there in addition to the likes of alabama auburn and byu dybantsa told me this process has been tough as hes adjusted to being a highprofile high school athlete but the insulation in his recruitment provided by his parents has made a lot of his daytoday much more manageable hell be tracked by scouts fans and coaches essentially daily from now until the night hes picked in the draft the hype has already begun but it will most definitely increase between now and his college debut in november of 2025 the excitement about the future of basketball is not just with dybantsa the top of the 2025 class has immense potential and could have more impact in college hoops than any freshman group in fiveplus years by the time they enroll thats a big takeaway from a lot of people this july in recent years juniors and seniors have run the sport harkening back to the way it was in the 1960s 70s 80s 90s and into the 2000s will that change a bit in 2024 2025 and 2026 remember this upcoming season is the last in college basketball with the bonus covid year for all players come 202526 well be back to normal and the average age in the sport will downswing it could lead to multiple freshmen being impactful at an allamerican level this class led by dybantsa wing is also highlighted by cameron boozer power forward and darryn peterson combo guard at the top some scouts think it could be an epic group for both college basketball and the nba draft toss in stud point guard darius acuff jr and big man koa peat to round out the top five in 2025 and you know what it feels like a freshman class at the top end that could be as impactful as some of the late 2000s and 2010 years when we had firstyear players capable of not only being really good but mattering on a national level and competing for national player of the year freshmen have become less valued in the hypertransfer portal era and for the most part i think their impact stands to be more muted than we saw from 20062019 the top of the 2025 class seems different boozer and his brother cayden have been dominant players for their entire run in high school be it on the summer circuit or in prep play for all the dybantsa hype boozers considered by some to be a surer thing in college where his role knack for winning and reliability for playing his best against the best competition is considered tantalizing duke florida and miami are considered the three schools with realistic chances to land the boozer twins cameron boozers productivity and translatable skills to the college level will have him entering the 202526 season with just as much intrigue as dybantsa boozer had previously been linked with flagg due to being in the same class until flagg reclassified but we should see boozer vs dybantsa at peach jam later this week which would be among the more anticipated headtoheads in the events history as for peterson who plays on the adidas circuit hes not as big as the other two but he might be just as strong he has an nbaready body right now peterson cuts an impressive figure and has traits as a combo guard that make him almost impossible to guard at this level some think peterson should be on the same tier as boozer and dybantsa and after seeing him dominate in rock hill i cant disagree if hes really the thirdbest player in this class then college basketballs freshman crop a year from now will probably be better than the terrific group were getting this year in flagg rutgers duo of ace bailey and dylan harper plus baylor stud vj edgecomb as multiple coaches and nba scouts told me if dybantsa boozer and peterson were all eligible for the 2024 draft they all may well have gone in the top five dybantsa almost certainly would have been no 1 as i watched boozer dybantsa peterson peat and others i remembered how there is no shortage of cautionary tales when it comes to overhyping prospects lets keep that at front of mind too not all of these guys are going to continue to grow get better and turn into allnba players or top10 college guys but there is an accepted truth among pretty much everyone in basketball that the 2025 class is better than many weve seen in recent years what do we have to thank for that more than anything nil with g league ignite gone and overtime elite now allowed to bring in players but still have them be eligible to play in college college basketball is benefiting from star talent in a way that it hasnt in some time from a star power perspective its entering into another really good era so if you thought flaggs inbound season at duke would be a oneyear burst for college basketball think again he should be tremendous but theres a good chance we see even better players the future of college basketball for the next three years looks bright and poised to deliver on freshman star power in a way we havent seen since zion thats a huge victory for american basketball across the board 20042024 cbs interactive all rights reserved cbs sports is a

get to one of the other countries and play a game considering you have a guy on the sidelines who hasnt played with a calf strain in a month now its just strange to me azarly added if the issue was only about injury concerns then durant should have been treated the same as kawhi as he had shown more visible signs of injury than kawhi had until then advertisement article continues below this ad is kawhi leonard being unfairly targeted while kevin durant gets a free pass react reactions when azarly pointed out usa basketballs double standards in a recent tweet booting kawhi early while keeping an injured kd on the squad he made it clear that the tweet wasnt meant as a shot at the slim reaper that was in no way a shot at kevin durant again kevin durant is an all timer hes an olympian he deserves to have that chance to be there azarly reiterated on the pod but his only concern was why kawhi wasnt given the same opportunity when they could have assessed his fitness by playing him in the showcase games and made a more sound decision moreover team usa head coach steve kerr made it clear that replacing kevin durant was never considered despite his injury yeah theres no thought of replacing kevin surely something smells fishy doesnt it on top of all this the clippers insider also revealed that just a day after he asked grant hill about an update on kawhi sometime around game 2 of the nba finals when there was no talk of his withdrawal adrian wojnarowski dropped a bomb revealing that derrick white was already in consideration to replace the twotime champion thats a strange timing moment tomer remarked with so many factors involved and every party telling a different story its nearly impossible to pinpoint the actual reason why kawhi is not playing in the paris olympics

Kawhi Leonard,Why Derrick White made more sense for Team USA than Jaylen Brown after Kawhi Leonard's withdrawal,https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/why-derrick-white-made-more-sense-for-team-usa-than-jaylen-brown-after-kawhi-leonards-withdrawal/,if not listed please contact your tv provider three boston celtics are playing for team usa at the paris olympics jaylen brown widely considered the teams secondbest player is not among them it didnt seem like much of a slight when the rosters were initially announced the starstudded group had to make cuts somewhere when lebron james stephen curry and kevin durant all surprisingly agreed to play following the disappointment of the 2023 world cup jayson tatum still made the cut jrue holiday would likely rank lower among all nba players than brown to most observers but his stellar play for team usa in tokyo during the 2020 olympics and his specialist skill set as a defensive ace made him a natural pick nobody called brown a snub when the roster was announced during the season but when kawhi leonard withdrew due to a knee issue brown appeared on the surface to be an obvious candidate to replace him he plays the same position as leonard and shares similar physical dimensions he is coming off of his first nba championship and is a reliable allstarcaliber player he even played for team usa before back in the 2019 world cup team usa didnt medal in that tournament but browns performance was largely acceptable in the end though team usa chose browns boston teammate derrick white to replace leonard brown seemingly didnt take that too well when the news came out he began tweeting cryptically eventually he directed his ire towards nike the manufacturer of team usas uniforms nike this what we doing brown is not currently signed to a sneaker deal anywhere but had previously worn adidas however in 2022 brown criticized nike founder phil knight for his treatment of kyrie irving after the thenbrooklyn nets star shared an antisemitic film on social media knight said that irving stepped over the line brown responded by rhetorically asking since when did nike care about ethics nike cut ties with irving soon after team usa executive director grant hill pushed back on the idea that nike was any sort of factor in the decision to add white over brown for a good portion of my career i wore fila hill joked that was supposed to be a joke were proud of our partners obviously usa basketball this is about putting together a team putting together a team on the fiba stage is an entirely different process than doing so in the nba think about the sheer degree of competition for talent in the pros and the constraints the salary cap creates when assembling it in the nba loading your team with star power means having three or four big names but team usa even in a weak year its generally feasible for the americans to send 12 allstars to the olympics when you have that degree of talent the things you need change drastically think about brandon ingram he was supposed to be one of the faces of team usa at the world cup last year he largely proved unplayable in hindsight that made plenty of sense ingrams best trait by far is his oneonone scoring ability he can make hard shots there are a finite number of players in the world who can reliably do so in the nba when 30 teams are fighting for 100 of that player pool getting even one of them is a major coup but team usa has access to 8090 of them at any given time and is only fielding one roster suddenly taking and making hard shots becomes less important when jalen brunson anthony edwards mikal bridges paolo banchero and tyrese haliburton are also on the team what you need under those circumstances are players who do everything else josh hart isnt nearly as accomplished at the nba level as ingram he was a significantly more important part of team usas world cup bid last summer because he makes his living doing the dirty work people ask what position does he play he plays winner head coach steve kerr said last summer team usa wants players like this that is why tayshaun prince and andre iguodala have gold medals right now brown emphatically is not ingram ingrams defense is theoretical most of the time brown is a reliably strong defender hes no star playmaker but he was just among the higherusage players on the most efficient offense in nba history he can function within a team setting clearly but a lot of the appeal of having jaylen brown is his scoring remove it from the equation as something team usa simply doesnt need and white starts to look more appealing white by virtue of his experience as a point guard is the superior playmaker he shot better from 3point range last season hes earned alldefense honors two seasons in a row brown has never made an alldefense team perhaps more importantly white has never made an allstar team unlike brown he wasnt a highlottery pick or a high recruit he spent most of his college career playing division ii ball and didnt arrive in the nba as a starter this means nothing in the nba its potentially important in an olympic setting featuring so much star power the reality of building an american olympic roster is that there arent enough minutes or shots for everybody neither brown nor white was ever going to get much run in the leonard slot because neither is as good as leonard team usa credibly could have started or closed games with him even if it hadnt leonard has genuinely competed for the title of best player in the nba so have the other players at his position lebron james and kevin durant are higher priorities here than whoever gets the 12th roster spot there is always a player or two sitting at the end of the bench as a break glass in case of emergency option its imperative that team usa fills those slots with players who arent going to let their egos get the better of them this isnt to suggest that brown has any sort of bad reputation within locker rooms hes just so accomplished as a player that hed probably arrive at team usa expecting to play a meaningful role because hes never not played a meaningful role on any team hes been a part of white has been a role player all his life if hes just here to practice hard and cheer from the sidelines then theres little doubt that hes going to practice hard and cheer from the sidelines there are worlds in which hes asked to do more than that this tournament strategically speaking is geared much more toward guards than wings remember luka doncic and slovenia just got knocked out before qualifying most of the other best wings in the world are american but germany just won the world cup with dennis schroder as by far its leading scorer canada is the only team in the field with multiple perimeter stars and both shai gilgeousalexander and jamal murray are guards there are even less famous players on the nba stage that morph into megastars in fiba play patty mills has averaged over 21 points per game in olympic play for his career hes never been a fulltime starter in the nba defensive guards in this field are more important than defensive wings team usas job is not to simply assemble the 12 most talented players available frankly if it was brown would probably miss out anyway donovan mitchell isnt on the team neither is jalen brunson or damian lillard or paul george or zion williamson almost any american allstar could construct a gripe if he really wanted to the difference between say the 15th and 21st best player in the nba is pretty small its team usas job to put together the group of 12 players who combined give it the best chance at winning gold sometimes that means grabbing the most accomplished player on the board sometimes that means identifying a specialist that makes sense in the context of the other 11 players and the 11 other teams it will face in the tournament that thought process led kerr and hill to white over brown and it was the right decision 20042024 cbs interactive all rights reserved cbs sports is a registered trademark of cbs

7 shakes hands with forward jayson tatum after a dunk during the slam dunk competition during nba all star saturday night at lucas oil stadium mandatory credit kyle teradausa today sports is jaylen browns controversy a sign of deeper issues within the team usa basketballs managing director grant hill has been caught in a wave of controversies since the olympics began it started with jaylen browns exclusion from the squad and then jayson tatum not receiving enough playing time during the olympic games even though hill said that he would consider brown in the 2028 olympic squad things have not cooled down yet team usa went to the olympics with a starstudded lineup which comprised 12 players toptier nba players yes they won the gold but it was not all sunshine and rainbows behind the scenes with that much talent not everyone got the minutes they wanted even the big names from the nba squads just look at jayson tatumhe ended up with multiple dnps as he sat out two whole games with no playing time and not everyone was happy with it in light of that veteran nba analyst brian windhorst advised grant hill to pick the young players going ahead to avoid all the drama the idea is to start developing the young players specifically for fiba competitions and to build a squad that is down to stick together through a few summers leading up to big events like the 2028 olympics i dont necessarily think its the worst idea in the world to take all young guys to the world cup like do what they do in soccer of the olympics and say we are gonna take all 23 and under windhorst mentioned on the espn podcast advertisement article continues below this ad because weteam usa are gonna start developing fiba players we are gonna say hey commit to playing in the summer in 2026 commit to playing the summer in 27 and you are not promised for 28 but lets see where it leads maybe there shouldnt be in spots 11 and 12 maybe there shouldnt be star players there maybe there should be fiba players nba players dont get me wrong but fiba players who have played for multiple summers in a row the media vet further added is jaylen browns controversy a ticking time bomb for team usa react reactions windhorst wants team usa to create a crew thats more in sync with international play after all its all about longterm growth and commitment not just banking on nba stars talking about nba stars though whats been brewing between grant hill and jaylen brown lets dive deep it was not that long ago that jaylen brown took a shot at team usa and nike letting everyone know he was not cool with team usa picking his celtics teammate derrick white as kawhi leonards replacement instead of him the current finals mvp tweeted nike this what we doing brown was probably implying it was nike that kept him off the team usa roster advertisement article continues below this ad in response hill said and so whatever theories that might be out there theyre just that but thats my responsibility and its tough its tough to have conversations tell people that theyre not on the team jaylen brown did not take too kindly to being called a conspiracy theorist by the usab managing director as he shot back stating grant hill calling me a conspiracy theorist is disappointing ive been a vp of the nbpa since i was 21 years old i have a great understanding however grant hill now wants to squash the beef he is even open to having brown on the team usa squad in the 2028 olympics its a lot of noise im confident he and i will sit down at some point and talk about it and get to some level of understanding hell be a candidate if he wants in 2028 one thing ive learned you cant take anything personally in this role i havent personalized anything my objective my goal is to win and as soon as hopefully that happens we pivot and start looking ahead to the future hill said as this might have been the last season for many of the veteran players in the olympics there will probably be space for jaylen brown on the team usa roster for the 2028 olympics but the question is after all that has happened will brown accept the offer to be a part of team usa what are your thoughts advertisement

7 shakes hands with forward jayson tatum after a dunk during the slam dunk competition during nba all star saturday night at lucas oil stadium mandatory credit kyle teradausa today sports is jaylen browns controversy a sign of deeper issues within the team usa basketballs managing director grant hill has been caught in a wave of controversies since the olympics began it started with jaylen browns exclusion from the squad and then jayson tatum not receiving enough playing time during the olympic games even though hill said that he would consider brown in the 2028 olympic squad things have not cooled down yet team usa went to the olympics with a starstudded lineup which comprised 12 players toptier nba players yes they won the gold but it was not all sunshine and rainbows behind the scenes with that much talent not everyone got the minutes they wanted even the big names from the nba squads just look at jayson tatumhe ended up with multiple dnps as he sat out two whole games with no playing time and not everyone was happy with it in light of that veteran nba analyst brian windhorst advised grant hill to pick the young players going ahead to avoid all the drama the idea is to start developing the young players specifically for fiba competitions and to build a squad that is down to stick together through a few summers leading up to big events like the 2028 olympics i dont necessarily think its the worst idea in the world to take all young guys to the world cup like do what they do in soccer of the olympics and say we are gonna take all 23 and under windhorst mentioned on the espn podcast advertisement article continues below this ad because weteam usa are gonna start developing fiba players we are gonna say hey commit to playing in the summer in 2026 commit to playing the summer in 27 and you are not promised for 28 but lets see where it leads maybe there shouldnt be in spots 11 and 12 maybe there shouldnt be star players there maybe there should be fiba players nba players dont get me wrong but fiba players who have played for multiple summers in a row the media vet further added is jaylen browns controversy a ticking time bomb for team usa react reactions windhorst wants team usa to create a crew thats more in sync with international play after all its all about longterm growth and commitment not just banking on nba stars talking about nba stars though whats been brewing between grant hill and jaylen brown lets dive deep it was not that long ago that jaylen brown took a shot at team usa and nike letting everyone know he was not cool with team usa picking his celtics teammate derrick white as kawhi leonards replacement instead of him the current finals mvp tweeted nike this what we doing brown was probably implying it was nike that kept him off the team usa roster advertisement article continues below this ad in response hill said and so whatever theories that might be out there theyre just that but thats my responsibility and its tough its tough to have conversations tell people that theyre not on the team jaylen brown did not take too kindly to being called a conspiracy theorist by the usab managing director as he shot back stating grant hill calling me a conspiracy theorist is disappointing ive been a vp of the nbpa since i was 21 years old i have a great understanding however grant hill now wants to squash the beef he is even open to having brown on the team usa squad in the 2028 olympics its a lot of noise im confident he and i will sit down at some point and talk about it and get to some level of understanding hell be a candidate if he wants in 2028 one thing ive learned you cant take anything personally in this role i havent personalized anything my objective my goal is to win and as soon as hopefully that happens we pivot and start looking ahead to the future hill said as this might have been the last season for many of the veteran players in the olympics there will probably be space for jaylen brown on the team usa roster for the 2028 olympics but the question is after all that has happened will brown accept the offer to be a part of team usa what are your thoughts advertisement

Grant Hill,USA Basketball: Grant Hill says Jaylen Brown will be considered for 2028 Olympics after omission in Paris,https://www.cbssports.com/olympics/news/usa-basketball-grant-hill-says-jaylen-brown-will-be-considered-for-2028-olympics-after-omission-in-paris/,if not listed please contact your tv provider usa basketball director grant hill hopes to clear the air with boston celtics forward jaylen brown brown took issue with not being selected as a replacement on the 2024 paris olympics roster after kawhi leonard withdrew from the team team usa elected to choose browns celtics teammate derrick white for the open roster spot leading to brown calling out usa basketball and nike the official apparel brand for team usa brown implied on social media that nike was the reason he was kept off the team to which hill responded at the time saying in part whatever theories that might be out there theyre just that but thats my responsibility and its tough its tough to have conversations tell people that theyre not on the team brown then shot back on social media calling out hill saying grant hill calling me a conspiracy theorist is disappointing ive been a vp of the nbpa since i was 21 years old i have a great understanding while the dust had settled on the situation since the olympics started hill said on the open run podcast with rachel nichols that he hopes to talk with brown and that he will be considered for the 2028 los angeles olympics when you have a team with the profile of players on this team you know theres going to be controversy you know that coming in i knew that i think what people fail to realize is im a fan of basketball and im a fan of these guys that are playing in the current eramy whole approach is to celebrate the greatness of todays players so yeah it was disappointing you gotta do your job ive tried to do this the right way when we first put out the roster back in april before it was announced i called certain guys i called paul george damian lillard jaylen brown i felt like they were of a certain stature where they deserved to hear it before it was made public and i appreciated their willingness to want to be a part of this but also wanted them to appreciate just how difficult this was to me that was leading with integrity doing the right thing recognizing who they are what theyve meant to usa basketball in years past its a lot of noise im confident he and i will sit down at some point and talk about it and get to some level of understanding hell be a candidate if he wants in 2028 one thing ive learned you cant take anything personal in this role i havent personalized anything my objective my goal is to win and as soon as hopefully that happen we pivot and start looking ahead to the future brown certainly has the resume to make the usa basketball roster especially after this season during which he finished as an nba champion and finals mvp while leading the celtics throughout the postseason to their first title since 2008 but making the roster for usa basketball is the most difficult team to make given all the talent you could argue that he shouldve been named the replacement over white but there were very good reasons to have white on the roster over brown too while team usa looks on pace to earn its fifth straight gold medal the 2028 olympics will be a total change of guard for the mens basketball team lebron james could be retired and kevin durant and stephen curry will be 39 and 40 years old respectively so naturally there will be more room for brown to be on the roster hill sounds more than ready to bury the hatchet well just have to see if brown is willing to do the same 20042024 cbs interactive all

Grant Hill,USA Basketball: Grant Hill says Jaylen Brown will be considered for 2028 Olympics after omission in Paris,https://www.cbssports.com/olympics/news/usa-basketball-grant-hill-says-jaylen-brown-will-be-considered-for-2028-olympics-after-omission-in-paris/,if not listed please contact your tv provider usa basketball director grant hill hopes to clear the air with boston celtics forward jaylen brown brown took issue with not being selected as a replacement on the 2024 paris olympics roster after kawhi leonard withdrew from the team team usa elected to choose browns celtics teammate derrick white for the open roster spot leading to brown calling out usa basketball and nike the official apparel brand for team usa brown implied on social media that nike was the reason he was kept off the team to which hill responded at the time saying in part whatever theories that might be out there theyre just that but thats my responsibility and its tough its tough to have conversations tell people that theyre not on the team brown then shot back on social media calling out hill saying grant hill calling me a conspiracy theorist is disappointing ive been a vp of the nbpa since i was 21 years old i have a great understanding while the dust had settled on the situation since the olympics started hill said on the open run podcast with rachel nichols that he hopes to talk with brown and that he will be considered for the 2028 los angeles olympics when you have a team with the profile of players on this team you know theres going to be controversy you know that coming in i knew that i think what people fail to realize is im a fan of basketball and im a fan of these guys that are playing in the current eramy whole approach is to celebrate the greatness of todays players so yeah it was disappointing you gotta do your job ive tried to do this the right way when we first put out the roster back in april before it was announced i called certain guys i called paul george damian lillard jaylen brown i felt like they were of a certain stature where they deserved to hear it before it was made public and i appreciated their willingness to want to be a part of this but also wanted them to appreciate just how difficult this was to me that was leading with integrity doing the right thing recognizing who they are what theyve meant to usa basketball in years past its a lot of noise im confident he and i will sit down at some point and talk about it and get to some level of understanding hell be a candidate if he wants in 2028 one thing ive learned you cant take anything personal in this role i havent personalized anything my objective my goal is to win and as soon as hopefully that happen we pivot and start looking ahead to the future brown certainly has the resume to make the usa basketball roster especially after this season during which he finished as an nba champion and finals mvp while leading the celtics throughout the postseason to their first title since 2008 but making the roster for usa basketball is the most difficult team to make given all the talent you could argue that he shouldve been named the replacement over white but there were very good reasons to have white on the roster over brown too while team usa looks on pace to earn its fifth straight gold medal the 2028 olympics will be a total change of guard for the mens basketball team lebron james could be retired and kevin durant and stephen curry will be 39 and 40 years old respectively so naturally there will be more room for brown to be on the roster hill sounds more than ready to bury the hatchet well just have to see if brown is willing to do the same 20042024 cbs interactive all

bird grant hill on jaylen brown while team usas olympic basketball experience has so far been smooth sailing the conversation around the selection process has arguably become the most controversial point jaylen brown a pillar of the champion celtics and the 2024 nba finals mvp was omitted from the us roster even after kawhi leonard was replaced shortly before the games got underway brown was clearly disappointed in not being selected insinuating that his past comments critical of nike the team usa apparel sponsor played a role in his exclusion usa basketball managing director grant hill has responded to brown saying that it was a not a conspiracy theory to pick other players but was simply a basketball decision brown then answered by saying he found hills conspiracy theory label as disappointing the public backandforth has not been an ideal moment for both brown and hill asked about the situation by nba reporter rachel nichols in an interview on wednesday hill offered a summary from his perspective its been a learning experience hill began first of all when you have a team with the profile of players on this team you know theres going to be controversy so you know that coming in and i knew that the us roster is inevitably stacked with worldclass talent including three of browns celtics teammates jayson tatum jrue holiday and derrick white hill said that he believes in the idea that players in the current era are better than those from earlier times including his own giving him a usually positive view and experience with todays nba stars as a result the tough conversation around brown has hurt it was disappointing hill said of the situation with brown you got to do your job you got to do the job the best you can ive tried to do this the right way when we first put out the roster back in april before it was announced i called certain guys i called paul george i called damian lillard i called jaylen brown i felt like they were of a certain stature where they deserved to hear it before it was made public hill added and i appreciated their willingness to want to be a part of this but i also wanted them to appreciate how difficult this was looking back on how he handled it hill still believes he managed the situation with integrity as a result he doesnt view the controversy with brown to be particularly deeprooted its a lot of noise im confident he and i will sit down at some point and talk about it and get to some level of understanding hill said of browns international team future look hell be a candidate if he wants in 28 brown will be 31 at the time of the 2024 summer olympics which will be held in los angeles hill is intent on keeping the door open one thing i learned you cant take anything personal in this role and so i havent personalized anything hill concluded my goal my objective is to win and then soon as hopefully that happens we pivot and start looking ahead to the future trivia grant hill was named acc mens

Grant Hill,"Celtics conspiracy: Jaylen Brown vs Grant Hill in nasty war of words, while Steve Kerr refuses to play Jayson Tatum in USA Olympics blowout",https://talksport.com/sport/1985440/celtics-conspiracy-jaylen-brown-kerr-jayson-tatum-olympics/,the reigning nba champions are going through a period of public dysfunction jayson tatum wasnt allowed on the court during team usas olympicopening 26point blowout of serbia on sunday and while tatum was roadblocked by head coach steve kerr boston celtics teammate jaylen brown is engaging in a nasty war of words with grant hill in public view hill who entered the naismith hall of fame in 2018 is currently the executive director for team usa and directly involved in roster decisions barely a month after tatum and brown teamed up to lead the celtics to an impressive 41 victory over the dallas mavericks in the nba finals the boston duo are either warring with team usa or being blatantly ignored by the team grant hill calling me a conspiracy theorist is disappointing ive been a vp since i was 21 years old i have a great understanding brown tweeted brown who is the vice president of the nba players association has suggested that nike is at the core of the decision to leave him off the roster hill fired back at tatum brushing off a suggestion that the veteran celtic being left off team usas roster was due to a sports business conflict this idea that theres a conspiracy theory i always love a good conspiracy theory but it was really truly a basketball decision hill said on the dan patrick show these are tough decisions but having gone through this with the fiba competition you want to find the right balance and the right pieces on the court that we needed and not to say that he wouldnt have been good theres a lot of guys you could go on a list of guys who are very capable and very qualified but for where we were it was the right decision and derrick white i think will help us as we pursue gold brown is far superior to white on the court brown has has three allstar selection and just won a first finals mvp while white who was called up just before the olympics

clear he believes nike conspired with team usa to keep him from competing in these summer games earlier this month he was asked directly about it by a reporter i do for sure there be more stuff to come with that brown said when asked if he felt nike played a role in the decision as of now im not going to comment on it brown the nba finals mvp also posted directly to the company nike this what

Grant Hill,Jaylen Brown responds to Grant Hill's comments about Team USA roster 'conspiracy theories',https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/jaylen-brown-responds-to-grant-hills-comments-about-team-usa-roster-conspiracy-theories/,if not listed please contact your tv provider boston celtics star jaylen brown did not like grant hills recent comments about usa basketballs decision to replace kawhi leonard with derrick white and not brown on the mens national team for the paris olympics grant hill calling me a conspiracy theorist is disappointing ive been a vp since i was 21 years old i have a great understanding hill the managing director of team usa which opened olympic play sunday against serbia said in an interview on the dan patrick show on friday that hed spoken to browns agent about the choice i dont know if that was before or after things went out on twitter hill said but yeah i mean i think this idea that theres a conspiracy theory i always love a good conspiracy theory but it was really truly a basketball decision these are tough decisions but having gone through this with the fiba competition you want to find the right balance and the right pieces on the court that we needed and not to say that he wouldnt have been good theres a lot of guys you could go on a list of guys who are very capable and very qualified but for where we were it was the right decision and derrick white i think will help us as we pursue gold after the announcement browns posts on social media made it clear he thought nike had played a nefarious role at the espy awards on july 11 he declined to elaborate at summer league in las vegas on july 15 when asked directly if the shoe company had something to do with him being left off the roster he told reporters i do for sure adding that there will be more stuff to come with that but as of now im not going to comment on it what hill said to dan patrick about conspiracy theories isnt much different than what he told reporters in vegas shortly after the news on july 10 you get 12 spots and you have to build a team and one of the hardest things is leaving people off the roster that im a fan of that i look forward to watching throughout the season throughout the playoffs guys whove been finals mvps guys whove been a part of the program guys whove won gold medals guys who i respect admire and enjoy watching but the responsibility that i have is to put together a team and a team that complements each other a team that fits a team that will give us the best opportunity for success and so whatever theories that might be out there theyre just that but thats my responsibility and its tough its tough to have conversations tell people that theyre not on the team in the interview with patrick though he went deeper on the basketball reasons that led usa basketball to white part of it hill said was that if coach steve kerr was going to play bam adebayo next to anthony davis in the frontcourt then it made more sense to add a guard to the roster heres hills full answer about the process of selecting white im glad you brought that up so you know we went to training camp and we didnt have kd kd was out kevin durant sort of coming back from a calf injury and then jayson tatum was late for arrival he didnt show up the first two or three days so we ended up having to sort of play anthony davis and bam adebayo together and we didnt know if that would work i think going into camp we thought lets have three centers much like in 96 when we had hakeem olajuwon david robinson and shaquille oneal and well rotate all three of them are different and provide different things and so well have sort of a threeheaded monster at the center position but what we found because we didnt have the numbers those first few days was that bam adebayo and atnhony davis can really play well together at both ends of the floor and at times might be our best defensive lineup so we kind of stumbled upon something we learned something about our group during those four days in vegas and so when we pivoted off of kawhi leonard we said ok we got a little bit of a logjam now at the 4 position lebron james kevin durant jayson tatum now bam adebayo all these guys can play the 4 and we envision them playing the 4 and so ok lets not bring another guy who might play that 34 position in lets bring in someone now who can really give us great defense at the point of attack that was also a priority for putting this team together being able to pick up fullcourt guard and pressure the point guards of opposing teams and jrue holiday might be the best in the world at doing this but having some injuries that we had during camp what happens if jrue gets hurt and so derrick white might be the second best in the world at pointofattack defense so that was sort of the thought process but we really learned about our team those days in vegas and discovered something with bam adebayo and anthony davis on the court together that we really werent thinking about prior to our arrival in vegas i thought this was great for our team to be able to feel the pressure was importantgrant hill on what he was think when the us was down 16 to south sudanparisolympics pictwittercom37e2liehiq even before that white was on usa basketballs

Grant Hill,Jaylen Brown calls out USA Basketball director Grant Hill for ‘conspiracy’ remark,https://www.bostonglobe.com/2024/07/28/sports/jaylen-brown-grant-hill/,jaylen brown and derrick white might be on good terms after usa basketball picked the latter as a lastminute replacement for the olympics roster it appears the same cant be said though for brown and the man who made that roster decision just hours ahead of the united states mens national basketball teams first game in the olympics brown called out usa basketball director grant hill on social media grant hill calling me a conspiracy theorist is disappointing ive been a vp since i was 21 years old i have a great understanding brown wrote in a post on x formerly known as twitter sunday morning brown who has been a vice president for the nba players association since 2019 was likely replying to a comment hill recently made on the dan patrick show advertisement grant hill calling me a conspiracy theorist is disappointing ive been a vp since i was 21 years old i have a great understanding this idea that theres a conspiracy theory i always love a good conspiracy theory but it was really truly a basketball decision hill said of browns exclusion from the roster in fridays interview these are tough decisions but having gone through this with the fiba competition you want to find the right balance and the right pieces on the court that we needed not to say he wouldnt have been good theres a lot of guys a whole list of guys who are very capable and qualified but for where we were it was the right decision derrick white i think will help us as we pursue gold when it was announced that white would replace kawhi leonard on the united states roster earlier in july brown made multiple social media posts questioning the decision he also implied that nike played a role in his exclusion from the roster in one post i do for sure brown told reporters later in july when asked if he thought nike influenced usa basketballs decision to leave him off the roster therell be more stuff to come with that but as of now im not going to comment on it brown who previously endorsed adidas has made critical remarks about nike in the past hill said that nike doesnt influence any roster decisions when it was first announced that white would replace leonard on the roster hill further explained the decision to pick white over brown and others during his appearance on the dan patrick show he said it was a matter of positional need adding that the team felt good about its forward situation after bam adebayo played power forward during practice advertisement lets bring in someone who can really give us great defense at the point of attack hill said of the decision to add white that was also a priority for putting this team together being able to pick up full court guard and pressure the point guard of opposing teams jrue holiday might be the best in the world at doing this but having some injuries we had during camp what happens if jrue gets hurt derrick white might be the secondbest in the world at pointofattack defense that was sort of the thought process hill also told patrick that he called browns agent to inform him that the celtics star wouldnt be on team usa for the olympics when white was added it was reported in june that white was the top replacement for leonard if the clippers forward was unable to participate in the olympics due to a knee injury while brown has expressed his frustration with usa basketball and nike in recent weeks he holds no hard feelings with white i called derrick

Golden Tate,"Tate & Lyle's dead lion to Salvador Dali designing Chupa Chups branding, the stories behind world's most famous logos",https://www.thesun.ie/news/12275028/stories-worlds-most-famous-logos/,tate lyle this week axed its 140yearold golden syrup logo after shoppers branded it grim the image created in 1881 showed a dead lion being swarmed by bees and was inspired by a biblical story of samson killing one of the beasts the new version features a lions head and a single bee mike ridley looks at the stories of some of the worlds other bestknown logos famous for its triangular shape the swiss chocolate features a logo with a mountain theme and the matterhorn peak in the swiss alps but if you look carefully youll also see the design contains the shape of a bear a symbol of the city of bern where it was first produced now just a single letter f the social media giants logo is kept simple on a blue background this is probably explained by founder mark zuckerberg being redgreen colourblind and finding blue the easiest colour to see the burger chains first restaurant was opened by richard and maurice mcdonald in 1937 in 1952 when the companys firstever franchise restaurant opened the design included two massive golden arches outside to attract customers nine years later these yellow arches were adopted as the burger joints logo the original emblem for the coffee chain which was founded in 1971 was a topless twotailed fantasy creature called a melusine but in 1987 the designer changed the colour to green and the image to a more modest goddess it is a myth that apple boss steve jobs chose an apple with a bite in homage to computer inventor alan turing who killed himself with a cyanidelaced apple jobs was on a fruitonly diet when he came up with it the reason for the bite was so people would not confuse it with a cherry it is also a play on the word byte it is alleged that in 1911 when lord montague put a statue of a woman on his rollsroyce silver ghost as a scandalous memento of an affair with his secretary other owners copied him following the trend legend has it that the luxury car firm commissioned a statue of a woman with her arms outstretched and clothes flowing to be put on every roller the spirit of ecstasy mascot still used today was born the legendary rockers were among the first bands in the world to have a logo nicknamed hot lips the symbol was commissioned in 1970 when the stones started their own firm to release their music new design graduate john pasche was paid just 50 for his work but the logo launched his career while some logos are dreamt up by unknown students or the companys owner this one for the spanish lollipop brand has a famous designer the colourful daisy style logo still used on the sweets to this day was designed in 1969 by surrealist artist salvador dali better known for his melting clocks up there with mcdonalds as the worlds largest restaurant chain subway was founded in 1965 by 17year old fred deluca to serve healthy food to athletes to save money he drew the logo himself the arrows on either end of the word are to symbolise food on the go the logo is now on 44000 outlets in 112 countries the bass brewery was founded in 1777 in burtonupontrent staffs and the red triangle it used on its ales became in 1876 the first registered trademark ever issued by the british government the prancing black horse of enzo ferraris company was first used on its cars in 1947 it is actually a tribute to world war one pilot francesco baracca who had a similar horse painted on his plane enzo visited francescos father who suggested he include it on his car it is perhaps the most famous logo in the world but the white words on red background was not created by a designer it was the companys bookkeeper frank robinson who coined the name cocacola and suggested two capital cs would look good in adverts the font he chose was a popular style of the 1880s when the drink was invented student carolyn davidson earned less than 30 in 1971 for designing the famous swoosh which nike boss paul knight did not like at first twelve years later after nikes logo became one of the worlds bestknown carolyn was given shares in the firm which would now be worth more than 1million the croc logo comes from the nickname of company founder and french tennis great rene lacoste he got the name after his team captain said he would buy him a crocodileskin suitcase if he won his next match he lost news group newspapers limited in

Jared Dudley,"Jared Dudley joins Mavericks' coaching staff after 14-year NBA career, calls it 'perfect fit and opportunity'",https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/jared-dudley-joins-mavericks-coaching-staff-after-14-year-nba-career-calls-it-perfect-fit-and-opportunity/,if not listed please contact your tv provider jared dudleys playing days are over but he isnt leaving the league on tuesday dudley announced that he would be retiring as a player in the nba and accepting a role as an assistant coach with the dallas mavericks under new head coach jason kidd dudley will reportedly have a spot at the front of the bench alongside new head coach jason kidd the move was originally reported by longtime nba insider marc stein and shams charania of stadium and the athletic dudley later confirmed it on his twitter account i been preparing this moment for a long time from deep talks with nash hill shaq bron booker beal ad giannis the list goes on very excited to join the mavs and jkidd staff perfect fit and opportunity time to get to work i been preparing this moment for a long time from deep talks with nash hill shaq bron booker beal ad giannis the list goes on dudley wrote very excited to join the mavs and jkidd staff perfect fit and opportunity time to get to work in addition to announcing his move to the mavs dudley also thanked the lakers organization owner jeanie buss lebron james and anthony davis for helping him win a championship late in his career man what a ride 14 yr nba career capped off by winning a nba championship with the lakers just want to thank god for blessing me also want to personally thank kingjames antdavis23 jeaniebuss and the lakers organizationwithout bron and ad i dont join lal or wing a dudley played the last two seasons of his career with the lakers and after he announced his plans to join dallas coaching staff the lakers thanked him for the veteran leadership that he provided during his time with the team httpstcofcgvztbupy lakers teammate lebron james even reacted in shock when he learned that dudley wouldnt be with the team anymore congrats to my guy if this true which it probably is but man f lebron wrote in a followup tweet james explained his uncensored initial reaction excuse my language but this one hurt for many reasons that you wouldnt understand kidd served as an assistant with the lakers for the past two seasons so the connection to dudley makes sense its also a smart move by the mavericks as dudley has been a vocal leader in las locker room and in previous stints around the league his presence on dallas coaching staff can provide this young team with a veteran voice who just finished playing in the league and serve as a bridge between the players and the coaches adding dudley is just the latest move in what has been an overhaul of the mavericks coaching staff and front office this summer longtime general manager donnie nelson and head coach rick carlisle stepped down following another firstround exit in the playoffs and an explosive article detailing the dysfunction that existed within the franchise that led dallas to bring in former nike executive nico harrison as the new head of basketball operations and hire kidd as the head coach dallas is hoping that these moves will help move the needle in the direction of more success in the postseason and in free agency two areas where this franchise has failed for the better part of the last decade 20042024 cbs interactive all rights reserved cbs sports

Anthony Edwards,Noah Lyles breaks silence on Anthony Edwards drama and Adidas shoe event snub,https://talksport.com/sport/basketball/2005961/noah-lyles-nba-anthony-edwards-olympics-adidas/,noah lyles confidence has landed him in hot water over the years but he always backs it up the outspoken american sprinter silenced the doubters at the 2024 olympics in paris capturing a gold medal in the 100m and winning an improbable bronze in the 200m while dealing with covid19 lyles is no stranger to controversy in the nba world more on that in a second and on monday rubbed basketball folk up the wrong way again over some resurfaced comments of his during an feature with sean gregory of time last year lyles appeared to take a shot at minnesota timberwolves and team usa basketball star anthony edwards who recently helped the us to olympic gold lyles had made it clear that he wanted a signature sneaker with his apparel sponsor adidas and was offended when in the middle of contract extension talks with the clothing and footwear giant the brand invited him to an event promoting anthony edwards new shoe you want to do what lyles said you want to invite me to an event for a man who has not even been to an nba finals in a sport that you dont even care about and youre giving him a shoe no disrespect the man is an amazing athlete he is having a heck of a year i love that they saw the insight to give him a shoe because they saw that he was going to be big all im asking is how could you not see that for me the resurfaced quotes caused quite the stir online with many people defending antman over the unnecessary disrespect it wasnt long before lyles caught wind of his resurfaced quotes and he took to social media to quieten the noise this is a rumor going around that i did not go to anthony edwardss shoe release because he didnt deserve it lyles said on x that is not the case he definitely deserves his shoes he is an amazing player the problem was finding time based on my prior engagement congrats on becoming an olympic champion this isnt the first time the olympic gold medalist has drawn the ire of basketball fans and pros last year he sparked a huge debate after claiming nba champions shouldnt be called world champions because its a league entirely made up of teams from the united states and canada toronto raptors winners of virtually every major american sport are known as world champions due to them being the biggest leagues in the world in that particular sport with the best players however critics including lyles said teams shouldnt call themselves world champions unless theyve played and beaten other nations teams you know the thing that hurts me the most is that i have to watch the nba finals and they have world champion on their head lyles said world champion of what the united states dont get me wrong i love the us at times but that aint the world twotime nba champion and 2014 mvp kevin durant wrote on instagram at the time somebody help this brother warriors star draymond green posted when being smart goes wrong with the facepalm emoji while suns shooter devin booker posted facepalm emoji however after lebron james and steph curry led usa mens basketball to gold in paris and diana taurasi and aja wilson did the same for the women lyles has somewhat softened his original stance its not a thing of if i consider or not lyles said itsthey are theyre olympic champions and in the olympic champions you face the whole world and they saw how difficult it is lyles added and of course they came out on top and of course i knew they would because we have some of the greatest athletes but they saw you cant just slap everybody together and say this is a great team you know there was a ton of countries out there who said hey were not lying down just because we dont play in the nba you know we have cohesion we have our own way of playing the game lyles continued and there was a lot of close calls but again like myself i have confidence in the us basketball team that they were going to make it all the way lyles original comments seem to be water under the bridge now booker was one of the people who congratulated him after he won the 100m gold in the stade de france it was crazy the team usa star told the athletic i mean it was great for america congrats to him however he added i still dont agree with the comment i feel like all the best talent in the world is in the nba and this is coming from an olympic gold medalist who believes that being an nba champion is probably harder to do this service is provided on

adidasregistered athlete lyles and adidas signed a multi year contract extension in february with the details of the deal remaining undisclosed after winning the gold medal lyles seemed to be

jamaican rival kishane thompson lyles was elated as the scoreboard announced the gold medal in favor of noah lyles however despite his clean victory the jamaican fans did not seem to be happy with the results they insisted that kishane thompson had been robbed of a deserving gold medal advertisement article continues below this ad reacting to the news noah lyles mentioned that the jamaicans were jealous because they did not expect lyles to come out all guns blazing especially when he was being thrashed for his slow timings all year round lyles stated unfortunately they went from not having a dog in the fight last year to having a great dog in the fight this year so they went from loving me to hating me very quickly the gold also meant that lyles had won his duel with ferdinand omanyala who gave an usain boltlike lookover to lyles after beating the american at the racers grand prix speaking about controversies and backlashes from the jamaicans noah lyles personal space was also not spared lyles announced his romantic involvement with jamaican female athlete junelle bromfield ever since then both lyles and bromfield have been constantly attacked by the jamaicans calling bromfield a traitor every time she cheered for lyles the fans also launched scathing attacks on bromfield after she faltered in her 400m outing in paris reacting to the hate lyles lashed out in a track world sports exclusive i have been getting the drama from jamaican camps for at least five years now thus with the above accounts it is evident that noah lyles might have won the olympic gold but he will

Anthony Edwards,"""Usain Bolt HAD a Shoe"": NFL Legend Slaps Noah Lyles With Ultimate Reality on Anthony Edwards & Adidas Controversy",https://www.essentiallysports.com/nba-active-basketball-news-usain-bolt-had-a-shoe-nfl-legend-slaps-noah-lyles-with-ultimate-reality-on-anthony-edwards-and-adidas-controversy/,more sports es fancast aug 12 2024 856 am edt via imago credits imago via imago credits imago usain bolts take on anthony edwardsis he right about the adidas controversy noah lyles has rubbed people the wrong way again last year he miffed the nba players and legends when he started the world championship debate now after team usa has brought home the gold an old story has resurfaced about lyles being unhappy over the nba stars entitlement in signature shoe deals as per the latest developments tensions heightened between adidas and lyles when they invited the paris olympics 100m gold medalist for anthony edwards shoe launch last year in a recent interaction with time before the olympics lyles revealed that he couldnt swallow the bitter pill because edwards did not even have the nba finals stamp you want to do what you want to invite me to an event for a man who has not even been to an nba finals in a sport that you dont even care about and youre giving him a shoe no disrespect the man is an amazing athlete he is having a heck of a year i love that they saw the insight to give him a shoe because they saw that he was going to be big lyles said ultimately lyles wanted to prove his candidacy for a signature shoe as a 3x world champion however it irked the athletic community as usual this time nfl legends shannon sharpe and chad johnson dropped their views on the nightcap after going through the whole of the adidas noah lyles controversy narrative exnfl star ochochad stated i think that hard part is that as a track runner the market and demand for a track runner shoe it wouldnt be as significant as a nba basketball player who was seen globally advertisement article continues below this ad via reuters paris 2024 olympics basketball mens group phase group c puerto rico vs united states lille pierre mauroy stadium villenevedascq france august 03 2024 anthony edwards of united states scores a basket pool via reuterssameer al doumy poll 1 of 4 who do you think handled the anthony edwards and adidas controversy better anthony edwards adidas noah lyles usain bolt have an interesting take join debate do you think dennis rodman was a good father to alexis yes no its complicated not sure have an interesting take join debate which of devin bookers rumored relationships surprised you the most kendall jenner jordyn woods christina nadin hannah harrison have an interesting take join debate who was the standout player in the usa vs france mens final stephen curry kevin durant rudy gobert evan fournier have an interesting take join debate shannon sharpe seemed to agree but he had a different analogy as he bulged in to ask ocho in a course of five months how many people are going to look at noah lyles feet the nfl legend followed it with another question in the course of an nba season how many people are gonna look at the feet of antman feet there was a brief silence following which ocho uttered every twothree days finally sharpe dropped an ultimate reality check for lyles as he said theres a reason why big guys dont normally get shoe deals because aint nobody buying the shoeswe could find two guys that had shoes michael johnson had a shoe and usain bolt had a shoe they still dont make those shoes why is that kobes been deceased for four years but they still make kobes they still make jordans theyre still gonna lebron when lebron retires and they still gonna make kd when kd retires theres a reason why noah noah lyles objection to attending anthony edwards shoe launch might affect his future relationship with adidas advertisement article continues below this ad earlier this year lyles signed a lucrative extension with adidas reportedly it was the most expensive deal for a track and field athlete after the legendary usain bolts deal with puma however just after signing the deal releasing a statement against a fellow athlete who endorses the same brand might land lyles in trouble ocho confessed the same as he stated there are certain battles that you shouldnt fight you pick your battles wisely as someone who is great at their sports stuff like this can turn brands away can turn market opportunities away even though youre a gold winner ochos partner sharpe explained that despite his demand for a signature shoe deal lyles cant promote the brand the same way as the nba stars the nba stars can get their fellow teammates to wear their shoes it happens quite often as the nba players have been seen donning lebrons and kobes however noah hasnt got that privilege since every track and field athlete wants to don his own name on the heel not others noah lyles should probably carry it easy as anthony edwards is already a loved name in the sports community despite his excellence lyles words might not seem amicable to all and it might not serve him well in the marketplace but who knows what fate awaits maybe lyles can get a signature shoe deal as the first track and field athlete just like anthony edwards what do you all

reutersevelyn hockstein stephen jackson vs noah lyles whos right in this heated exchange over anthony edwards and adidas gold at the paris olympics proved there is no end to noah lyles success but no end to his feud with the nba either it seems the 27yearold already landed in controversy with his remarks on nba champs but this time its about a particular nba star the comment stemming from his desire to get a sneaker deal with nike seems to be an attack of sorts on minnesota timberwolves anthony edwards while the ant man has not responded yet former nba star stephen jackson seems to be done with the insult for his league the official instagram account for bleacher report recently posted lyles comments about edwards his mouth ruining his career by the minute jackson commented on the post notably the comments were recently revealed by times sean gregory mentioning there existed a tension between adidas and lyles that stemmed from the brand inviting the track athlete to the wolves stars shoe release event you want to invite me to an event for a man who has not even been to an nba finals in a sport that you dont even care about and youre giving him a shoe lyles said as per the report

deal im dead serious i want a sneaker aint no money in track spikes theres money in sneakers he said its worth mentioning landing sneaker deals is not an easy task for track athletes usain bolt has been among the rare ones to crack it with puma his frustration couldve been understandable had it not come at the expense of another athlete and its not as if this is the first instance that lyes has thrown shade at nba stars advertisement article continues below this ad this came during a press conference when lyles secured gold at the world athletics championship during the conference the

i think its important to have a mix of those guys on the staff you dont want a full staff of guys like that you also dont want to have an entire staff made up of guys that wont necessarily understand what these players are going throughrossy and the people that were around napoli everyone spoke so highly of not only was he a great teammate but a great base runner really paid attention and focused

role since 2020 into the dugout as their game strategy and catching coach prior to the 2022 seasonthe cubs felt the change upgraded both areas and played to each coachs strengths base running instruction is among napolis dutiesits given him accountability fire does his homework on the pitcher does the small little things you have to do on the opposing team that has made him even more invested in the guys ross said because he wants all of them to have success and tries to create friendships with all those guysnapoli is enjoying his new role he admitted he was getting worn out by his previous position and didnt have much to do in the dugout during gamesi felt like i was turning into a psychologist napoli said i was trying to talk people down like bro everythings ok it just turned into that kind of thing but being out there now every time having something to do to worry about and have my own area its been awesomeveteran catcher yan gomes and napoli were cleveland

of being a mentor and a coach but for me he doesnt have to change who he was with me in 2016napoli generally considers himself a chill laidback guy maybe that sounds surprising given the party at napolis moniker that gained attention during clevelands run to the world series a fan created a sign with the phrase in april 2016 inspired by napolis celebration style after winning the title in 2013 the sign caught napolis and the teams attention which turned into an official tshirt with proceeds reaching more than 200000 donated to the cleveland clinic childrens hospitalwhether its bonding over card games or putting in long days at the ballpark napoli is embracing his role with the cubsi did like to have fun off the field i mean i think everyone knows that napoli said but i think thats where you get to know your teammates and i always like bringing people together sometimes we get a little cliquey in the clubhouse if it was off the field you want to have a party or do whatever it was that

Chandler Parsons,NBA Veteran Asks Caitlin Clark’s Haters to “Eat S**t” in Surprise Rant After Historic Nike

apr 15 2024 brooklyn ny usa caitlin clark before the 2024 wnba draft at brooklyn academy of music mandatory credit brad pennerusa today sports caitlin clark and her counterparts made womens basketball a mustwatch in the ncaa since last year that value hasnt waned for any of them going into the wnba but their salaries have from millions in nils as collegiate athletes clark and other female basketball players have taken a huge pay cut entering the wnba clarks 76000 rookie salary is spurring the pay disparity discussion in comparison to nba rookies but chandler parsons subscribes to the old notion that someones salary is nobodys business the no1 draft pick overall ncaas alltime scoring champion and the newest indiana fever star is close to signing a historic 8figure endorsement contract with nike yet some trolls think a lowpaid wnba rookie doesnt deserve a big sneaker deal parsons though is on the side of people getting paid so while he was on run it back he told all the clark trolls all these people making fun of caitlin clarks wnba salary eat st cause shes making more money than you so keep hating shes changing the game shes awesome she deserves it and shes gonna kill it in the wnba i hope this is just the beginning of these girls getting these massive deals advertisement article continues below this ad yes its disappointing that the stars of ncaa like clark cameron brink rickea jackson and reigning champ kamilla cardoso are tied at the highest rookie salary with roughly 76535 for the wnba while their male counterparts get paid more parsons started at 850000 in 2011 victor wembanyama will earn over 12 million for this season his nike shoe deal is rumored to be worth 100 million but parsons deal with anta was a tad lower 1 million compared to clarks advertisement article continues below this ad but he also has a point since most players earn more than their proleague salaries through endorsement deals considering her nil worth was 31 million her endorsement appeal is at its prime and worth as much moreover parson projected that its only upwards for clark and other wnba rookies from here parsons got practical a little bit there when he said their salaries are crazy so theyre going to find other ways for them to make money since these ladies are already attracting major sponsorship deals the retired pro is excited for whats to come advertisement article continues below this ad this is a huge start for women in general and the wnba and for those who are jealous clarks outearning them he says she got a bag so keep laughing at her salary but shes the peak and when the ink dries on that 8figure nike deal caitlin clark will have the last laugh all the way to the bank essentiallysports is a digitalfirst sports media house that

Bam Adebayo,Can Team USA help Bam Adebayo become a stretch big man for the Miami Heat?,https://www.sbnation.com/nba/2024/7/24/24205128/bam-adebayo-miami-heat-team-usa-olympics-stretch-five,filed under adebayo is stretching out his game with team usa and it could be a big benefit for the heat bam adebayo is one of the best twoway players in basketball in every season from 2019 to 2023 adebayo finished in the 80th percentile or higher in both offensive and defensive estimated plusminus per dunks threes but given that the miami heat sat around idly as their eastern conference contemporaries grew stronger namely the new york knicks and the philadelphia 76ers they are going to need adebayo to hit another level if they hope to keep pace adebayos recent performance against team serbia during olympic play has some people pinpointing a pathway for his ascension developing into a bonafide stretch big given how he ended last season and what hes doing today 202425 really could be the season bam becomes a legit stretch big adebayo isnt the interior scorer that guys like giannis antetokounmpo or anthony davis are he was only in the 32nd percentile in rim frequency among bigs last year per cleaning the glass so adding a consistent threepoint shot is a great way to increase his scoring volume without tanking his efficiency plus it adds floor spacing to a heat team that desperately needs it but how viable is it for adebayo to become a true stretch big man a stretch big man is a center who can hit enough threes at a high enough clip in order to compel defenses to pay attention to them when they are spaced on the perimeter shooting 45 percent from three means very little if you are only attempting one three per game the same is true for someone taking nine threes a game and only hitting 25 percent of them although i doubt any coach would allow a player to attempt that many threes if that were the case the case for bam adebayo becoming a stretch big man while i am by no means a shot doctor most good shooters have two things going for them good touch and a quick release last season adebayo shot 357 percent on 42 threepoint attempts that isnt nearly enough of a sample size to extract any insight from but as a general rule you can also get a sense of a players touch by looking at their midrange and free throw percentages adebayo has multiple seasons that demonstrate his proficiency in both those areas not only does adebayo hit midrange jumpers and free throws at an aboveaverage rate for his position but he does it on elitelevel volume adebayo clearly has pristine touch the problem is that his release speed isnt nearly as enticing the following montage of clips probably wont say too much until we look at some other players but notice how long it takes adebayo to launch catchandshoot threes the type of threes spacers take and how much of a dip he has in his shot this exaggerated dip is a big reason why adebayo was only able to launch 06 threes per 75 possessions 7th percentile to better understand adebayos chances of developing into a stretch big man were going to compare adebayos indicators to other players who started out as nonthreats from the outside but later developed into legitimatepassable stretch big men brook lopez arguably the most famous example of a player who went from nonshooter to stretch big is brook lopez lopez took just 31 total threes during the first eight seasons of his career only to launch 2651 in the next eight even before lopez was hoisting triples at an extreme rate he always exhibited great touch in 201516 the last season before his transformation lopez was in the 90th percentile in midrange frequency and the 87th percentile in midrange efficiency as for release speed lopezs current release first clip in the montage below is much quicker than adebayos as evidenced by his significant advantage in 3point volume 63rd percentile in 3point attempts per 75 last year but the major worry for adebayo here is that lopezs release was always pretty quick second clip even before he became a true stretch big as we will see in a second it will become a recurring theme that it is very difficult to change release speed throughout ones career at least for centers al horford the only example of a selfmade stretch big that is as famous as lopez is al horford in his first eight seasons he took a few more threes than lopez 65 of course horford went on to beast that total by taking 2210 threes in the last nine seasons like lopez and adebayo horford flashed great touch from the midrange and free throw line before he started taking a bunch of threes and also like lopez but unlike adebayo horford had very little dip on catchandshoot jumpers even prior to his earning the stretch big moniker the clip below is from the 201415 season sidebar 1 despite his elderly status horford still maintains a pretty quick release larry nance jr larry nance jr doesnt have the reputation as a spacer that lopez and horford do last season he shot 415 percent from three a major step up from the 10 percent he shot during his rookie season but he did it on pedestrian volume 14th percentile in threes per 75 on top of that nance has not shown the same level of midrangefree throw shooting pedigree that the other three players weve discussed so far between him adebayo lopez and horford nance is the only one who has a career free throw percentage under 70 percent 696 percent on a spectrum of stretch bigs he falls much closer to the passable end than the legitimate one with all that said nance like lopez and horford has always touted a speedy release although he does have more of a dip than lopez and horford wendell carter jr wendell carter jr didnt surpass the 30 percent mark from downtown until his fourth season in the nba but that didnt stop him from becoming a 374 percent threepoint shooter on solid volume 40th percentile in threes per 75 last year his touch is nothing to write home about either carter has finished below the league average on midrange jumpers in three of his six nba seasons including the 202223 season as for his release speed it is the most comparable to adebayos slow with a pronounced dip here is an example from the present day first clip in the montage below and one from before his emergence as a shooter second clip sidebar 2 i also studied the jumpers of myles turner and jaylin williams and both of them have always had quicker releases with very little dip the bottom line so what do all these numbers and historical analysis mean for adebayos chances here we focused on two players lopez and horford who went from being zero spacers to elite ones for their position and two players nance and carter who went from selfcheck to solid stretch centers even before their evolution lopez and horford always had great touch a quick release and very little dip on their jumper adebayo may have that first feature but his shooting mechanics are lacking in the other two areas making it hard for me to envision him ever becoming an elite stretch big nance doesnt have adebayos touch and he also lets the ball dip quite a bit when he shoots it from three however his release iswas noticeably faster than adebayos and even then he isnt that effective of a stretch center adebayos best role model for this journey is carter adebayo has more proven touch but both of them share similar mechanical shortcomings at the end of the day if adebayo is going to be a stretch big it is likely going to be similar to the type of spacer carter is that isnt needlemoving floor spacing see how unimpressive the orlando magics offensive rating is when carter is on the floor so pairing him next to another poor spacer still wouldnt be ideal but if you can manage to surround him with four good spacers that could lead to a pretty wideopen basketball court sidebar 3 if you are wondering why i focused solely on players currently in the league for this study its because before the paceandspace era it was very uncommon for a center who wasnt a good shooter coming into the league to become a volume 3point shooter check your inbox for a welcome email oops something went wrong

Tyler Lockett,How ‘Tyler Toe Tap’ Lockett showcases the NFL’s fanciest footwork,https://theathletic.com/5058871/2023/11/14/tyler-lockett-toe-tap-seahawks/,nfl the athletic has live coverage of the dallas cowboys vs seattle seahawks on thursday night football tyler lockett is the official real estate partner of the seattle seahawks a business venture he keeps separate from his role as the teams offensive captain and star receiver but his highlightreel catches have his teammates and coaches campaigning for lockett to claim ownership of a specific piece of land at lumen field advertisement one day in the way distant future when tyler hangs them up i hope they have a bunch of footprints in that left corner of lumen field to represent all the amazing plays hes made in that same spot over and over again offensive coordinator shane waldron said in sundays win over the washington commanders lockett demonstrated that his stellar spatial awareness isnt limited to the south end zone the entire field is locketts playground when its time to flash his fancy footwork lockett is second in seahawks history with 58 receiving touchdowns and his latest at lumen field a diving snag while dragging both feet in near the right sideline in the north end zone was another illustration of how he has mastered the art of the toe drag that 5yard score gave seattle a 2619 lead late in the fourth and another reason for his teammates to marvel at his work for the lead pictwittercomejahvbeowz seattle seahawks seahawks november 13 2023 everybody know tyler is tony toe tap rookie receiver jaxon smithnjigba said hes been doing it for years always awesome every time he does it lockett leads the seahawks with four receiving touchdowns this year and three have required the nineyear veteran to be precise about where he placed his feet at the catch point in detroit in week 2 before he caught the game winner in overtime he finished a crossing pattern with a defender draped all over him in the back of the end zone against the browns in week 7 lockett came through on an offscript overtheshoulder grab in that sweet spot in the south end zone of lumen field that little corner back there we have to call it tylers corner because hes caught so many touchdowns back there quarterback geno smith said lockett is on pace for more than 900 yards and seven receiving touchdowns and if he hits those marks it would be the sixth straight season hes done so his consistency combined with a lack of individual accolades hes never made a pro bowl or allpro team as a receiver contribute to lockett being widely regarded as one of the leagues most underrated receivers its a label lockett doesnt like but its nonetheless appropriate go deeper tyler lockett and quandre diggs the special bond between 2 overlooked seahawks stars in seattle theres no shortage of love for lockett especially when hes gliding along the sideline for one of his signature toe taps every time you see it its like a wowing thing man smith said for most of locketts teammates and coaches their introduction to his surreal sense of spatial awareness came in the first quarter of seattles win over the los angeles rams on thursday night football in october 2019 thats when russell wilson faked a handoff to running back chris carson turned and scrambled over 24 yards before lofting a 13yard touchdown pass to lockett in the back left corner of that south end zone the ball hung in the air for two seconds and traveled nearly 22 yards advertisement as lockett awaited its arrival he tracked it while being faceguarded by safety eric weddle the ball sailed toward the back pylon and lockett cradled it with both hands his action green adidas cleats tapping the turf and his body in full extension with a slight tilt reminiscent of michael jacksons gravity lean in smooth criminal you cant get any better ball placement toe tap and late hands receiver cody thompson said thats the epitome that clip a clip the seahawks show often in meetings one that never gets old it doesnt matter how many times we watch that rams clip in the back of the end zone quarterback drew lock said its still one of the sickest toe taps of all time tyler lockett did that what a grab tdlockett12 larvssea on fox httpstcopfuffe7hxs learn how to watch httpstcoi6invckndx pictwittercomccgdaurlwl nfl nfl october 4 2019 locketts toe tap against the rams which according to next gen stats had a completion probability of 53 percent came in the fifth game of dk metcalfs rookie year metcalf had seen some of locketts sideline work in practice but that moment took it to the next level i found out quickly how serious he was with the toe tap metcalf said you can never count lock out when you throw him a jump ball or anything hell go up and catch it and always get two feet in sanjay lal also quickly picked up on locketts signature snags a longtime receivers coach lal joined seattles staff as a senior offensive assistant in 2020 he learned that locketts catch against the rams was as common an occurrence as a rainy day in seattle what i didnt realize its every day said lal who spent a year with jacksonville in 2021 before returning to the seahawks as the receivers coach and passing game coordinator a lot of receivers you see the splash play with the corner catch the toes inbounds youre like ok everyone has made one of those but thats him advertisement lockett is listed at 5 foot 10 and 182 pounds not exactly the prototypical size for an elite toetapper there are times he snags the ball at its highest point and drags his feet as was the case on his 29yard reception against the eagles in the wildcard round of the 2019 playoffs but lockett prefers to let the ball come to him at just the right moment before the defender can disrupt the timing lal explains the uniqueness of locketts combination of body control and handeye coordination by pressing his sneakers together near the mesh point between the teams practice field turf and the concrete he stretches his arms toward the cement while motioning toward his outside shoulder the spot where lockett typically snags passes hes made himself comfortable outside the framework lal says receivers are taught to catch it toward their inside shoulder where defenders struggle to poke it out lockett is uniquely adept at the opposite approach which is unnatural for most other receivers hes trained himself to make that catch lal says lockett has developed a reputation for being automatic on these catches particularly on crossing patterns in the red zone in 2020 he beat arizona cornerback dre kirkpatrick in the back of the end zone on fourthand2 in the fourth quarter it was officially a 3yard td but the ball traveled nearly 33 yards before lockett dove tracked it over his shoulder and got two hands while first tapping his left foot inbounds then dragging his right the pass had a completion probability of 154 percent according to next gen stats and most of his body was out of bounds when he completed the catch another wellknown catch on locketts highlight reel is his 4yard touchdown on another crosser against the panthers in week 14 last season at lumen field the ball traveled 32 yards and lockett was 07 yards from the back line that time in nearly the exact spot as the arizona catch the routine was the same track the ball over the shoulder one foot down then drag the other toe tap tyler carvssea on fox stream on nfl httpstcovwp8oh9fmk pictwittercom9vm65z1598 nfl nfl december 11 2022 his feet almost go dead and they drag along the ground as his momentum is still shifting tight end noah fant said thats something thats super special takes a lot of practice and takes a lot of body control to be able to do that not very many people can do it like he does thats what is so special the ball lockett caught in that same spot of the end zone at ford field in week 2 against detroit traveled 29 yards and had a completion probability of 336 percent according to next gen stats and it was even tougher because cornerback jerry jacobs was draped all over him advertisement its phenomenal hes unfazed by contact lal said the seahawks teach receivers to play through contact but for lockett it comes naturally when that ball is in the air thats all thats in his mind how do i separate how do i get my hands on that ball and let my body do what he does naturally last season safety julian love defended a rare unsuccessful toetap attempt in seattles week 6 win over the giants lockett ran a corner route and beat love to the left sideline in the end zone on secondand12 from the 21yard line but couldnt quite get both feet inbounds but even that play showcased locketts savvy he gave love false hands when they crossed the goal line causing love to jump as if the ball was coming then lockett dropped his arms kept running and shot them up again later love jumped again and lockett tracked the ball over his shoulder while creating 13 yards of separation its little things like that that are kind of unorthodox and savvy of him love said thankfully his toes were out of bounds when asked if other players have been able to mimic locketts signature move lal replied with a firm no but that doesnt mean they arent trying thompson is always picking locketts brain about that part of his game either on the field or in the film room thirdyear receiver cade johnson is too metcalf hasnt borrowed the toe drag yet this season but his touchdown against the giants in week 4 was the type of late hands catch lockett has become famous for locketts influence is undoubtedly spreading across the receiver room he just leads by example johnson said its one of those things where youve gotta just watch and let the magic happen thus far the best lockett impression belongs to undrafted rookie jake bobo whose two touchdowns this season looked like they came straight out of the tyler toe tap handbook against the panthers in week 3 bobo snatched smiths pass at the highest point in the back of the south end zone shielded the ball from the defender and tapped both toes near the backline for a 5yard touchdown the encore in week 7 versus arizona was equally impressive bobo soared over cornerback starling thomas and corralled the pass with one hand while leaving barely any space between the nike logo on his cleats and the sideline in the back corner of that same end zone jake bobo has just made the most insane touchdown catch youll see today fox pictwittercomlzagvnieae seattle seahawks seahawks october 22 2023 i think now we can say jakes probably up there with tyler when it comes down to the toedrag swag smith said thats the impact of having a great teacher i learned from the best in no 16 bobo

sports es fancast aug 11 2024 528 pm edt anthony edwards vs noah lyleswhos got it right in this heated debate track and field star noah lyles doesnt seem really happy despite winning a gold and a bronze medal at this years olympics hes out there taking it out on nba stars perhaps he cant get enough this time too he wasnt afraid of speaking his mind lyles attacked not just anthony edwards this time but also adidas with whom hes had a good working relationship with since 2016 his reactions are getting backlash from not just fans but also nba star jalen brunson after lyles successful completion of the paris olympics journey a tweet started to go viral on x regarding the entire adidasedwards fiasco with him mocking edwards brunson couldnt keep quiet and responded damn i thought this was centel brunson was notably referring to the account as a fake one but once the social media user behind the account tweeted the entire incident brunson realized that lyles wasnt in his best demeanor towards edwards damn i thought this was centel httpstcojgtupk0jih jalen brunson jalenbrunson1 august 11 2024 expand tweet advertisement article continues below this ad is noah lyles out of his mind with his latest attack on adidas react reactions the roots of the problem began to sprout in 2023 when lyles first attacked adidas as he was invited by the brand to a shoe release for edwards edwards had notably got a deal with adidas and his ae1s were released in november that year during that time lyles was in negotiating with adidas and was invited to the minnesota timberwolves star shoe release which apparently didnt go down with lyles things went downhill as lyles saw it as a minor gesture to appease him and questioned edwards capabilities and whether he deserved his presence in lyles eyes it was a major disparity you want to invite me to an event for a man who has not even been to an nba finals lyles stated lyles then asked the billiondollar company to give him a shoe deal by presenting his arguments and youre giving him a shoe no disrespect the man is an amazing athlete he is having a heck of a year i appreciate that they saw his potential for success all im asking is how could you not see that for me lyles enumerated as for the record edwards co have made it to the conference finals this passing nba season which has been his best achievement in the nba to date hence it made lyles question adidas therefore brunson was joined by other fans who slammed lyles even jalen brunson admitting noah lyles is out of his mind you know its bad one fan commented the user was pointing out that brunson wasnt satisfied with lyless answer despite the fact that the two are compared oftentimes this is why i celebrated noah not winning another balling fan commented that he celebrated when lyles failed to bag gold in the 200m notably due to covid19 lyles had to be satisfied with bronze in the 200m in this olympics advertisement article continues below this ad nah noah lyles is just a world class hater another balling enthusiast stated the user was most probably pointing out that lyles had stated in august last year that ballers werent world champions where track and field athletes compete with the best stars from different countries as per him since the nba is based mostly out of the usa they didnt deserve as much acclaim as lyles perhaps there was always a good reason people hated him lmao his own peers in track think hes a fucking weirdo with the way he acts its not personal he just makes unneccesary shitty comments bc hes a shitty person it is what it is hes jealous a pocket watcher and big mad another person criticized lyles the netizen was most probably pointing out the fact his peer letsile tebogo had called lyles arrogant and loud enumerating that these qualities were responsible for making him the world face of athletics noah lyles is kinda meh meanwhile one fan looked to support lyles as per him lyles deserved a deal with adidas and was correct when he slammed edwards this year lyles inked an agreement with adidas which is said to be the most lucrative after usain bolts retirement advertisement article continues below

sports es fancast aug 8 2024 208 am edt derrick white over kyrie irving for the olympicssmart move or a huge mistake usa basketballs selection process for the 2024 paris olympics hasnt pleased many the community in the last few weeks has witnessed memorable moments snubs and bigtime controversies we tell you along with bringing back lebron james after he last played in 2012 steph curry and anthony edwards also made it to the roster the issue arose when derrick white was sent as kawhis replacement instead of jaylen brown 2016 gold medallist kyrie irving was also excluded with 8 years younger tyrese haliburton despite the uproar and draymond criticizing his own gsw coach another exwarrior believes that what happened was for the best demarcus cousins and quinn cook discussed tyrese haliburtons inclusion in the team usa roster quinn initiated the topic stating you need a guy whos not gonna be mad when not playing this was an indirect dig at jaylen brown as the team usa roster was reportedly concerned whether someone of jaylen browns caliber would accept having a significantly reduced role therefore with the team filled with dominating scorers like lebron kd etc the need was for a player who wouldnt mind staying on the sidelines obviously jaylen brown kyrie irving from a talent perspective and what theyve done even with their resumes theyre supposed to be on the team but when youre putting a team together just sometimes you need your derrick white quinn cook said on above the rim with dh 12 the topic of the basketball world has been jayson tatum not playing yeah if derrick white dont play thats expected advertisement article continues below this ad being the secondincommand in their respective franchises both jaylen brown and kyrie irving are expected to carry the offensive effort which grants them more oncourt minutes during the nba finals between the boston celtics and the dallas mavericks brown averaged 385 minutes throughout five games while irving averaged 39 minutes while derrick white himself wasnt that far behind with his average of 367 minutes his scoring wasnt on par with that of his celtics teammate and mavericks rival poll 1 of 4 who do

paris france august 05 2024 derrick white of united states arrives at the usa house reuterstingshu wang during the 2016 rio olympics kyrie irving went on to average 222 minutes over 8 games with 17 minutes being used up to add only 4 points in the finals against serbia in contrast lebron james has averaged 205 minutes at the paris olympics while kevin durant just 196 therefore irvings previous record of taking up a bulk of the minutes which may or may not generate the required points may have played a role in his exclusion after jaylen brown hinted that his exclusion from team usa was because of his sour relationship with nike the teams managing director grant hill was quick to come out with a response he went on to state that the responsibility that i have is to put together a team and a team that complements each other he had to decide on these grounds even if it meant not taking in finals mvp as highlighted by quinn cook the management simply may not have believed that taking in jaylen brown andor kyrie irving would have been worthwhile if they had just remained on the sidelines another exnba player however had a stronger reasoning siding with the celts nike agenda and providing more reasons for the same now that weve opened this can of worms lets dive deeper after jaylen brown made headlines for blaming nike reactions started to pour in from all sides many former nba players including gilbert arenas and rashad mccants agreed with the celtics stars sentiment during a segment of his gils arena podcast the wizards legend even went on to state that team usa was allegedly a nike event that just sidelined players who arent a part of the billiondollar brand mccants highlighted that both players were at one point in time associated with the brand until complications arose jaylen brown sided with kyrie irving he spoke out against nike dropping kyrie said mccants nike dropped kyrie after the post jaylen brown didnt like that i think he was the president of the players association at the time he was obligated to speak out about what nike did why they did it he didnt like it he was wearing kobes at the time so he started covering up his kobes

garden mandatory credit david butler iiusa today sports back in 2022 kyrie irving suffered from repercussions after he posted antisemitic content online this involved the nets suspending him and nike ending the endorsement deal that they signed with the player in 2014 by that point it had been 3 years since irving had left the celtics and much of the boston fanbase had turned against the player advertisement article continues below this ad despite this brown in his capacity as vp of the nba players association stated his disagreement with the terms that irving needed to fulfill for his franchise suspension to be revoked when it came to nike brown took to his official x account and wrote since when did nike care about ethics this according to reports is what soured the relationship between nike and the 2024 nba champion after grant hill went on to state that brown blaming nike was just a conspiracy theory the celt had to remind him that as vp of the nba players association he has a great understanding of how things work brown and irving may have been excluded from the 2024 roster simply because of the playing minutes issue however no one can deny the fishyness that this

record of taking up a bulk of the minutes which may or may not generate the required points may have played a role in his exclusion after jaylen brown hinted that his exclusion from team usa was because of his sour relationship with nike the teams managing director grant hill was quick to come out with a response he went on to state that the responsibility that i have is to put together a team and a team that complements each other he had to decide on these grounds even if it meant not taking in finals mvp as highlighted by quinn cook the management simply may not have believed that

reigning major champions need kim who last played a major in 2011 does liv golf need a new poster boy was a stillvivacious comparison between tiger woods and anthony kim also tempting the great white shark advertisement article continues below this ad anthony kim was expected to take the mantle from tiger woods not the mantle of 14 majors that woods raked in then while many expected kim to reach double digits with majors it was still a little early kim was expected to take on the mantle of being the tours poster boy lets also not forget the time of kims appearance the pga tour plunged headlong into the postwoods era after the sun of tiger woods seemed to be waning rory mcilroy too was yet to storm the stateside with sheer force kim burst into the scene after making much noise in the walker cup and collegiate golf turning pro at 21 kim played in two pga tour events in 2006 bagging a runnerup finish in his debut the next season was a hint at what was to come with ten top25 finishes from his 26 outings kim landed in 2008 that year the rising star became the first golfer since tiger woods to win two events in the same season before turning 25 may 4th 2008 fan favourite

10 to put that into more context he was the only player under 25 and the third player under 30 but its not his achievements alone that made him part of the lore rather what kim represented stood higher than what he achieved on the greens paul azinger kims us team captain said the rookie ryder cupper was their offthecourse team leader azinger recounted he wanted sergio all week he kept saying i want to play sergio zing i want to play sergio it never worked out until sunday and we got lucky anthony ate it up and responded he said on the first tee im going to whup his a for you today captain that aggressiveness was what the golf world was looking for after tiger woods that brash and raw talent and the sheer nonchalance in the face of intense pressure made anthony kim an instant hit azinger added he was pointing at me and if you can read his lips he was saying i told you i was going to whup his a kim was a hotshot descended on the greens rocking belt buckles with his initials

that mystery definitely added to the lore golf yeti veteran sportswriter alan shipnuck dubbed kim seemingly greg norman wanted the combination of these two a star who can pull the crowd and someone who given a chance can still perform reasonably well will it pay off arguably kim is likely to rake in more eyeballs than rahm did in his debut how well that translates to the later games depends on how well and how fast kim comes back in form there have already been speculations about whether the comeback hero can score a sub70 in his first round at liv golf jeddah in his last round as a

today sports is tyus jones the missing piece for a championship team or just another solid role player for minnesotans the name tyus jones is equivalent to what lebron james is to basketball before he tyus was a junior in high school if you typed apple valley into google it showed up apple valley california now it shows up apple valley minnesota the wizards guards older halfbrother jadee jones said in 2017 clearly the impact of the second of the jones boys was far and widereaching and why wouldnt it the 28yearold was practically a legend in his hometown so much so that the mayor of apple valley declared april 22nd as tyus jones day after the duke product led his team to an ncaa title in 2015 and entered the nba draft then again it shouldnt come as a surprise we suppose jones is after all part of a rich basketball heritage advertisement article continues below this ad if you ask tyus who was the most influential figure in his basketball arc hed immediately point to jadee 10 years older than tyus he was pretty much fluctuating between being a father figure and a friend a former division i basketball player jadees dream of being a basketball trainer took off with tyus and his younger brother tre jones having graduated from mankato in 2009 with a degree in health and exercise science he arrived just in time to help tyus poll 1 of 4 what should tyus jones prioritize in his next nba

studies the game and knows the body im thankful to have an older brother like that in my corner tyus jones once recounted by now you must have gotten an idea of who tre is a post shared by tyus jones 1tyus aside from being the younger brother of mr minnesota basketball the youngest jones is also part of the san antonio spurs the 24yearold was selected as the 41st pick in the 2020 draft night both brothers are duke alums if you thought this was all the jones brothers then we have another surprise for you there is a third halfbrother reggie bunch a 66 forward who played at robert morris university you can relax now no more surprises but tyus basketball lineage does not end here his father rob jones competed at division iii wisconsinparkside while his mother debbie was a state title holder in north dakota as a point guard jones also has an aunt darcy cascaes who won two championships with devils lake high school and was an allconference guard at the university of north dakota and yet another prominent minnesota face al nuness jones uncle was the captain of the minnesota gophers in the 1960s the eldest son of al jared nuness tyus cousin was just as good on a basketball court as the rest of the family we are well and truly done with the roots section of tyus jones and now lets move to his accolades what were you and i doing in eighth grade yeah think about that for a moment while we tell you what tyus did he was the varsity starter for apple valley high school averaging 168 points and 81 assists per game successfully leading the team to a 208 record and starting in every one of them yup let that seep in so we ask you again what were you doing as an eighth grader he continued in his starting point guard position for five years with apple valley and led them to their first state title furthermore jones won the aau national championship and three gold medals with usa basketball in 2011 2012 and 2014 there was no doubt that hed be the mcdonalds allamerican in 2014 either and of course in the process with duke he won the national championship earning the ncaa tournaments most outstanding player award but that wasnt all he was also named to the final four most outstanding player a post shared by tyus jones 1tyus not too soon after tyus was selected as the firstround 24th pick in 2015 draft night although he was selected by the cleveland cavaliers almost like a dream come true tyus was traded to the minnesota timberwolves that very night in return for cedi osman rakeem christmas and a 2019 2ndround pick a month after that the wolves signed jones to a 2year 262 million contract alternating his time between minnesota and the idaho stampede the d league affiliate of the utah jazz a year later minnesota proceeded to exercise the team option signing tyus jones to a 14 million option for 20172018 this repeated the next year as the wolves once again exercised the 244 million option for the 201819 season and for the last time in 2019 minnesota extended the 357 million qualifying offer as the young guard became a restricted free agent on july 11 2019 tyus said an emotional goodbye to his hometown team and joined the memphis grizzlies on a 3year 264 million contract he spent almost 35 years with the grizzlies before he was traded to washington as part of a threeteam trade advertisement article continues below this ad a post shared by tyus jones 1tyus in july 2022 he signed a twoyear 29 million contract with memphis although he was set to be an unrestricted free agent in the 202425 season tyus jones made it clear that if the wizards would have him back he would be more than happy to return to dc his family loves the place and more importantly he believes he can finally play a starting guard instead of a backup advertisement article continues below this ad for now though tyus remains one of the hottest free agents remaining and while the lakers are encouraged to pursue him so far there havent been any updates on any such moves if los angeles does have any such plans theyd better act fast someone of tyus jones caliber isnt likely to stay free for long the loaded free agency this year certainly had put him at a disadvantage given how that noise has subsided the former duke product wont find himself short of suitors for long essentiallysports is a digitalfirst sports media house that surfaces the

to be the reds arjen robben bayern munich and chelsea legend robben enjoyed a glittering career at european footballs highest level the 39yearold was known for his trademark cut inside onto his left foot before fizzing a shot towards goal like robben antony prefers cutting inside to beat his man however he has yet to find the same form as the legendary dutchman and has a big season ahead of him to prove his worth to the old trafford faithful speaking to paddy power saha believes the brazilian has what it takes to reach the same heights as robben but will need to improve his performances antony has that arjen robben style about him where he cuts in the from the righthand side and hits it with his left foot he explained also read antony set goal target for the upcoming season whenever

player just as he started his journey in the nba at first giannis had some misgivings since he had worn adidas all his life but a call with susan mulders of nike basketball cleared any such doubts

vice president kamala harriss meeting with israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu follows his talks with president joe biden it comes as a new poll shows ms harris has narrowed the gap against donald trump friday 26 july 2024 0241 uk please use chrome browser for a more accessible video player us vice president kamala harris has said she raised serious concerns with israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu about the scale of human suffering in gaza i made clear my serious concern about the dire humanitarian situation there she said i will not be silent she added following talks at the white house ms harris said we cannot look away from what was happening in the wartorn palestinian territory as she called for a ceasefire deal to free hostages still being held by hamas ms harris also said israel has a right to defend itself and how it does so matters the talks have been closely watched by commentators for signs of how the expected democratic presidential nominee might shift american policy about israel if she becomes president her remarks to reporters after the talks were sharp and serious in tone reflecting what could be a shift from president joe biden in how she deals with mr netanyahu family members of american hostages being held captive in gaza held productive and honest talks with joe biden and benjamin netanyahu today gathered outside the white house relatives said they are more optimistic about a deal to release their loved ones than they have been in months we got absolute commitment from the biden administration and from prime minister netanyahu that they understand the urgency of this moment they said jonathan dekelchen whose son sagui was taken by hamas from kibbutz nir oz on 7 october told the times of israel that there was pressure building on mr netanyahu i think the prime minister understands that not only are the eyes of the world on hamas right now theyre also on him he said because so many different sides both within israel but also outside of israel are saying the conditions are there kamala harris and benjamin netanyahu have begun talks in washington the israeli prime minister met with joe biden earlier where the president reiterated his calls for israel and hamas to quickly agree to a ceasefire deal that would bring hostages home ms harriss meeting with mr netanyahu is seen to be even more important than the one with mr biden after the president ended his bid for reelection and endorsed the vp she is also expected to press israels leader on securing a deal to release the hostages kidnapped during hamas 7 october attack on israel that launched the war i look forward to our conversation we have a lot to talk about ms harris said in greeting mr netanyahu echoing the president almost wordforword we do indeed mr netanyahu replied about 29 million people watched joe bidens televised oval office address last night according to american data firm nielsen the tv viewership for the 11minute speech was slightly higher than the 254 million people who tuned in for donald trumps acceptance speech at the republican national convention last week mr biden who rebuffed weeks of pressure from democrats to step aside said ive decided the best way forward is to pass the torch to a new generation thats the best way to unite our nation israelis will be paying close attention to kamala harris meeting with benjamin netanyahu today says international correspondent john sparks israels prime minister met with joe biden today where the president was expected to push mr netanyahu to finalise a ceasefire deal in gaza that would see hostages returned to their families white house officials said the deal was closer now than weve been before but that gaps remain between parties mr biden brought family members of hostages with him into his meeting with mr netanyahu in an attempt to apply pressure on the israeli leader to get a deal completed mr netanyahu is meeting with ms harris in a separate meeting the vice president chose not to attend the israelis address to congress yesterday and there is uncertainty about where she stands on policy toward israel israelis will be looking very carefully at kamala harris says sparks whats her position going to be on israel in the event that she becomes the us president she has been more willing to talk about the scale the sheer scale of human suffering in gaza than president biden has so therell be watching that meeting very carefully kamala harris says she is ready to debate former president donald trump ms harris is on her way to being named as the democratic partys candidate to face mr trump in novembers presidential election she is in washington to meet with israeli leader benjamin netanyahu today and speaking to reporters beforehand said im ready lets go i have agreed to the previously agreed upon 10 september debate she said after landing at joint base andrews he agreed to that previously i think the voters deserve to see the split screen that exists in this race on the debate stage the upcoming us election could be among the closest fought in generations the latest new york timessiena college poll shows that among likely voters donald trump leads kamala harris 4847 in a headtohead match this is a marked improvement for the democrats compared to the timessiena poll in early july that saw joe biden behind by six percentage points that came in the aftermath of the poor debate performance which would eventually drive him from the presidential race mr trump leads ms harris 4846 among registered voters he had led among registered voters by nine percentage points over mr biden in the postdebate poll voters are seemingly becoming more tuned into the presidential race just before the june debate only 48 of voters said they were paying attention to the campaigns that figure now stands at 64 the poll of 1142 registered voters was conducted following joe bidens decision to not seek reelection it has a margin of error of 33 percentage points if you havent already heard the phrase border tsar levied against kamala harris the chances are you will do soon the moniker is quickly becoming the favourite attack line from republicans trying to tarnish ms harriss reputation on immigration searches for the term have spiked this year as per google trends data while donald trumps campaign chief has acknowledged its the partys best line of attack against ms harris republicans have adopted it more and more in recent weeks kamala had one job nikki haley told the crowd at the partys national convention in milwaukee this month one job and that was to fix the border now imagine her in charge of the entire country this week mr trumps running mate jd vance said the border crisis is a kamala harris crisis and speaking last night in north carolina mr trump himself said under border tsar harris millions of aliens are pouring into the country the label is starting to stick to ms harris like glue but where does the term come from and is it fair bidens thankless task the term has its roots back in march 2021 when joe biden announced he would be giving ms harris the task of coordinating diplomatic relationships to address the root causes of migration into the us it appeared to be a thankless task the assignment was a longterm one nobody in the white house was expecting the vice president to solve border surges quickly at best any benefits from addressing these root causes would take time to appear at worst ms harris would become the face of the border crisis one of the biggest political vulnerabilities of the biden administration is harris in charge from the moment ms harris was given her new task she was described as the person in charge of the migration crisis by the media but this isnt true that job belongs to and always has belonged to the secretary of homeland security alejandro mayorkas and the secretary of health and human services xavier becerra ms harris was never put in charge of the border or immigration policy nor was she involved in overseeing lawenforcement efforts responding to the crisis the white house had to field frequent questions on what ms harriss role exactly defined but that sometimes proved tricky at one point senior officials said ms harris would oversee a wholeofgovernment approach to dealing with migration harriss missteps at the same time it didnt help that ms harris made some gaffes that would come back to bite her she was criticised by immigrant rights activists for a speech in june 2021 in which she urged folks in this region who are thinking about making that dangerous trek to the united statesmexico border do not come do not come she was also repeatedly criticised for not visiting the usmexico border and for a confusing interview with nbcs lester holt in which she dismissed questions about it a record that speaks for itself the irony here and the one that ms harrisd campaign team will be desperately trying to push is that her record on immigration throughout her career has been widely praised her first ever bill as a senator was to give immigrants detained while trying to enter the country access to lawyers that came shortly after mr trump had enacted a travel ban on citizens from muslimmajority countries she also publicly supported the deferred action for childhood arrivals program that protects undocumented youth brought to the united states as children from deportation as a prosecutor she opposed federal legislation that would have criminalised providing legal assistance to unauthorised immigrants as vice president her task has been tough but june 2024 saw the lowest number of illegal border crossings into america since january 2021 will anything change probably not as shown by mr trumps rally in north carolina last night the term isnt going anytime soon immigration is a top concern for us voters and it might serve ms harris well to make a clear pitch on how she will deal with the issue if she becomes president there are still gaps that remain in talks over a ceasefirehostage release proposal between israel and hamas according to the white house joe biden and benjamin netanyahu have been in talks today where key elements including the fate of the hostages are being discussed there are gaps that remain said white house spokesperson john kirby we believe that they are of a nature that can be closed and we can achieve a deal but it will require as it always does some leadership some compromise and some effort to get there mr kirby also repeated a claim made by mr netanyahu during his address to congress yesterday that iran has been funding and encouraging protest activity in the us during his speech mr netanyahu labelled protesters as irans useful idiots israelis didnt hear anything in benjamin netanyahus address to congress that they wanted to hear says a former senior policy adviser to the state department mr netanyahu spoke for more than an hour in washington as he seeks to drum up support for the ongoing war in gaza the visit is seen as a political risk for the us and the protests both inside and outside the capitol yesterday testified to that speaking to sky news today laura blumenfeld said mr netanyahus speech didnt go down well in his home country theres a real difference between his soaring rhetoric yesterday and the grim stats and the reality back home in israel said

Connor Barwin,Welcome to Trieste: Former NFL star buys into Italian basketball club with starstruck history,https://theathletic.com/4680711/2023/07/17/connor-barwin-trieste-basketball-eagles/,nfl in 1985 as part of a nikesponsored trip to europe michael jordan ended up in the seaside italian city of trieste jordan played in an exhibition game for local club pallacanestro trieste wearing its jersey when he mimicked his signature logo during a fast break and dunked with such force that he shattered the backboard the jordan brand released the shattered backboard air jordan 1 in 2015 to honor the event which has become part of trieste lore advertisement the visit helped strengthen an appreciation for basketball in a city where american troops were stationed following world war ii and that engrained basketball culture was one of the appeals for former nfl pass rusher connor barwin and five classmates from the university of pennsylvanias wharton school mba program for executives aka the cotogna sports group who purchased a 90 percent stake in the club for 5 million in january in the teams home stadium fans still wear the jersey jordan wore in 1985 as they bang drums wave flags and sing from the opening whistle you walk down the street people are wearing red and white said fitzann reid a coowner and finance lawyer if a team loses a regularseason game grown men are crying its such a passion for basketball that i didnt know existed outside of the us they are the first american owners in italian basketball since kobe bryant was an investor in a group that purchased olimpia milano in 1999 and if this is the basketball version of welcome to wrexham barwin is the most recognizable face go deeper wrexhams hollywood promotion how reynolds and mcelhenney helped end 15 years of hurt he played four years in philadelphia and was one of the markets most popular athletes he lived in center city and rode public transit biked to work and became a staple in the community parks are cleaner playgrounds are safer and musical tastes are refined because of barwins work hes been asked before when is he running for mayor the eagles had a job waiting for him soon after he retired from the nfl in 2019 and he has been a member of the front office ever since now the director of player development he went to wharton on the side the group first looked at soccer but a professor gave them a lead on trieste two hours from venice and near the borders of basketball hotbeds slovenia and croatia nba star luka doncic grew up about one hour away the new owners thesis according to barwin was that european basketball is probably close to where european football was 20 years ago advertisement the fans have been there a long time and theres a rich history of this team he said and if anybody asked me why this team its 100 percent because of the fan base and how much they love this basketball team before his nfl career which included a pro bowl berth and secondteam allpro honors with the eagles in 2014 barwin played college basketball in the big east when the conference produced eight ncaa tournament bids during a year when it was an eightbid conference he has preserved relationships in basketball that now stretch into the college and professional ranks which he thinks he can leverage to the teams advantage along with his nfl connections but hes more than just the jock of the group hes developed really strong instincts and a really solid knowledge base of what good business looks like said richard de meo another coowner and current president of the trieste team who serves as ceo of the foenix partners brokerage firm in london he definitely brings that kind of sprinkling of stardust to conversations with his name and with his nfl associations sure without a doubt but hes a contributor in terms of good business instincts barwin spent three months leading an exhaustive search for a general manager before hiring michael arcieri last month arcieri worked for four nba franchises before becoming the general manager at varese and winning the italian top leagues equivalent of the executive of the year award barwin considers hiring the general manager and the coach as the most important responsibilities for an owner and he utilized the philosophies he learned while working in the eagles front office during the search last tuesday trieste hired jamion christian the former george washington siena and mount st marys head coach to lead the team this season there has been a stigma at times against american ownership in europe eight premier league soccer clubs have north american owners as do six of italys top 20 clubs per the associated press every sport league and club offers its own nuances but after spending autumn sundays in philadelphia barwin found it easy to draw a simple conclusion about sports ownership youre a steward of the franchise its not your team its the fans team advertisement i think playing in philadelphia might have been the best thing to prepare me for this opportunity said barwin who grew up in detroit as the son of a city manager you realize how connected you are with the fan base and the community and you understand your role and you really understand this magical thing only works when you all sort of work together and complement each other i cant speak to any other american whos invested in european soccer or basketball but i think if you ever go into it thinking this is a great business opportunity and its all going to be done on spreadsheets and youre just gonna hire somebody to go over there being an operator its really hard to be successful de meo speaks italian and has lived and worked in the country and while the group has american sporting culture sensibilities he said theres a priority to be culturally sensitive there wont be a halftime show competing with the fans synchronized singing without consultation we didnt want to be the american owners that come in and knew better and started to implement changes without understanding first what theyve done in the past de meo said what barwin has learned in six months is how different italian basketball is from what he follows in the nba a 40minute game once a week in the italian league brings comparisons to the nfl theres an investment and a meaning that might not be present in february in detroit on the second day of an nba teams backtoback barwin watches games in the basement of his philadelphia home with his wife laura and two children and wants to find a way to make it easier for american basketball fans to view their games he has seen firsthand how media rights and streaming possibilities are revenue opportunities and he believes trieste offers a product that likeminded americans can enjoy its so fing entertaining barwin said we play 30 games we play once a week its 40 minutes and theres promotionrelegation so everything matters and the players can feel that the fans feel it its a roller coaster ride of the season and these are some of the best players in the world i mean theres only so many people that can play in the nba he would know find footage of former ohio state star greg oden the 2007 no 1 nba draft pick playing a muchanticipated game in his hometown of indianapolis against cincinnati on dec 16 2006 youll see stretches where the bearcats assign the 7foot center to a shaggyhaired 6foot4 guy who looks like a football player advertisement its common to hear players explain how other sports were their first love its less common to see how deep the relationship went barwin played two seasons of college basketball for the bearcats after walking on starting 11 games in 200506 for a 21win team but he showed more promise in football where he moved from tight end to defensive end and became a secondround pick in 2009 had he stuck with basketball its conceivable he could have played professionally overseas that connection made him even more interested in the opportunity with trieste if youd asked me when i was 14 what i want to do it was definitely be a professional basketball player not a football player barwin said i was just better at football i think basketball players are the greatest athletes in the world its really hard to play in the nba and there are a lot of great players that are playing around the world the lega basket serie a lba italys first division has restrictions on the number of nonitalian players on a roster and those restrictions are even tighter in a lower division like serie a2 where trieste finds itself after being relegated months after the purchase by the wharton group barwin says they see rules as opportunities the academy system is different than in american basketball allowing for a pipeline there are good players in italy and the ownership group wants to become a destination for americans playing overseas if i would have known that there was this opportunity over in europe barwin said italy is not a bad place to go play trieste is a beautiful city to go live in if youre an american for eight months out of the year the new owners want to incorporate data analytics and the wharton network has already been a resource de meo mentioned opportunities with artificial intelligence there are also strides that can be made in player wellness and mental health where memphis grizzlies team cardiologist john jefferies another one of the new owners may be able to use his expertise and connections advertisement the club was not purchased as a flip the ownership group is operating with a long runway which is why the threat of relegation which occurred after it bought the club but before it could make many material changes was viewed as more of an obstacle than a deterrent the goal is to earn promotion back to serie a then compete to play in the euroleague the business and operations are undergoing modernization theyre seeking nonbasketball stadium events barwin hopes there eventually will be a new arena and that the club can become a pipeline then the wharton group hopes to replicate the trieste model by investing in other sports franchises when barwin first joined the eagles front office in 2020 his title was special assistant to the general manager he has seen how many talented people work for sports franchises but had limited impact on decisionmaking part of building what barwin termed a modern basketball operation is creating an environment where talented executives and coaches innovate if they do well they can continue to rise up the basketball food chain im hoping we become a place where coaches can go and you can win and you can develop players barwin said and if you can galvanize a community and a team and do it all in italy you can definitely go do it in the nba barwins not particularly good at retirement he followed a 10year career by almost immediately joining the eagles front office there are more exotic vacations to take after a decade of wrestling offensive tackles than a week at the senior bowl in mobile ala his travels to italy bring him to a crowded arena of screaming members of curva nord the passionate fan group that supports trieste not a yacht on the amalfi coast i knew that playing was going to end and i wanted to stay involved barwin said i didnt know exactly how and i still dont know exactly how but i love sports i love the way it brings people together i love the people that ive gotten to know and work with and i dont think theres many things out there that sort of bring people together and make you feel the emotions that sports do advertisement barwin wants to retire the term retire from professional athletes he tells players as much in his day job theyre not retiring theyre just done playing barwin said and for me ive always thought of it that way i was done playing football after the 2018 season thats it hes busier and he makes less money but hes stimulated by the work he meets with his ownership

pm on 8 july 2024 lets begin with our top story here is a minireview of despicable me 4 the film is driven solely by the purpose of cashing in with a plot that is as inconsequential and as scattered as the minions swarming around and with none of the laughs and little of the warmth this is despite adding yet another member to the family of gru carell this time a baby meanwhile lucy and the girls are battling their own transition and their mean neighbours daughter called poppy king who proclaims that its not that she doesnt respect elders i dont respect boomers indian express rated the film 1 out of 5 stars actors ryan reynolds and hugh jackman recently sat down for a conversation with the indian chapter of marvels youtube channel jackman a keen cricket fan described by reynolds as obsessed with the sport was asked about his favourite indian cricketer without hesitation jackman named rohit sharma meanwhile ryan reynolds was asked which bollywood actor he would like to work with

cop axel f an approximation of 80s actioncomedies but with an eye on contemporary anxieties this movie is an uneven experience that doesnt make you want to hurl an adidas shoe at your screen as some other recent netflix movies might have but also doesnt leave much of an impression the movie finds murphys titular troublemaker answering a call to home and confronting his past as always its the emotional undercurrent that grounds axels increasingly outlandish escapades directed by debutante mark malloy beverly hills cop axel f doesnt have the retro energy of the new bad boys films indian express rated the movie 3 out of 5 stars next up filmmaker mira nair and actor shabana azmi spoke about the importance of an actor remaining connected to common people and how difficult this can become as they become famous mira said in an interview at the new york indian film festival alongside shabana azmi tom cruise has in his contract that you cannot meet his eyes youre not allowed to

has been snapped up by northampton town following his release from port vale red devils icon ryan giggs was serving as interim playermanager at united when he tipped wilson for a bright future following a brace on his senior debut giggs saw potential in the young wilson and decided to give him a start in their penultimate premier league match of the 201314 season against hull city wilson returned the favour by bagging two goals as united triumphed 31 over the tigers marking himself out as a rising star for the future however the english striker never quite lived up to the promise his debut suggested read more mason mount breaks man united silence with threeword promise after announcement read more i wasnt enjoying it manchester united star must decide his own future amid transfer rumours he featured infrequently for united over the subsequent four years before leaving permanently for aberdeen in 2019 it was only six months later that he returned to england with salford city spending a seasonandahalf at moor lane before moving to port vale wilson was among the players the club released following their relegation to league two at the end of last season however the forward will remain in englands second tier the former wonderkid didnt have to wait long to find a new club as northampton announced his signature now serving as director of football at wilsons old club salford giggs reminisced about the time he gave the youngster his first start and lauded the qualities the striker initially showcased at old trafford i remember wed been beaten and i wanted to throw in some young players said the united legend james came across he trained really well i already knew about him because he was a goalscorer he was scoring regularly for both the reserves and the youth team uniteds adidas home shirt is made up of the same colour of the citys iconic red rose and features a black collar the collar also features a dash of both red and white giving it a slick and modernised look prices start from 55 he really impressed me with the way he trained and the way he had an eye for a goal and he had the dream debut didnt he he scored a couple of goals hes always been a really good finisher he had his injury problems but hes a good lad he always wanted to improve now on his third team in four years the 28yearold hasnt wholly reached the potential he first displayed with the red devils however he now has a new opportunity to impress in league one with the cobblers hoping to reach the same heights that saw him bag a careerhigh 15 goals in his debut campaign at

Michael Robinson,"Collecting the cards of ‘The Jackie Robinson’ of the other major sports: Earl Lloyd, Kenny Washington and more",https://theathletic.com/4979290/2023/11/04/jackie-robinson-trading-card-value-earl-lloyd/,jackie robinson is on the mount rushmore of the vintage card hobby and its easy to see why he was a great player and his societal impact in the united states transcended his sport when he broke through segregation in baseball in 1947 lately in the past five years his cards have been strongly appreciating robinsons 1954 topps card is up 348 in a psa 5 excellent condition his rookie card 1948 leaf is up 414 his 1953 topps is up 700 so lets call it about a 500 return across the spectrum using auction prices via the psa website the most conservative way to value cards advertisement vintage cards of other black sports pioneers in the major us mens leagues are also going up in value as well as for one of the most prominent black athletes ever the boxing pioneer jack johnson heres a look at how the hobby has considered cards depicting some of the biggest figures of racial progress in american culture and our assessment of the markets lets focus on the top leagues first and save johnson for last bobby marshall and fritz pollard are widely credited as the first two black players to compete in the nfl when they debuted in 1920 but professional football was well behind baseball and boxing in terms of its popularity then and there are no vintage cards for them leading into the 1946 season at least four black players were signed by nfl teams but not all were issued vintage cards kenny washington who played baseball at ucla with robinson and woody strode signed with the rams and marion motley and bill willis signed with the browns which were in a rival league that was absorbed by the nfl willis was not issued a vintage card and neither was strode who became a movie star with appearances in spartacus and perhaps most famously in the opening to once upon a time in the west so lets start with washington who has a 1948 bowman rookie card black and white these prices are up 500 to 250 since 2018 in psa 5 ex condition note the last sale of a 5 was 2021 but a psa 4 sold recently for 256 though its very well centered and thus more valuable than the technical grade washington also has a 1948 leaf card faux color that qualifies as a rookie card and those are up 900 in the more common black name variety they can be had for about 350 in a nice psa 4 id wait on more sales for this one before going close to 900 which seems too high frankly advertisement motley is a hall of famer a threetime rushing champion who averaged 57 yards per carry and 130 yards per catch he revolutionized the running back position to one of size and power as well as speed his rookie card is a 1950 bowman and very tough to find centered you can get a psa 5 now for about 500 and thats up 400 since 2018 i think this card is a strong buy still the last psa 3 a very recent sale sold for about 400 over 2018 prices i think a psa 5 1950 motley centered is a legit 650 card in the foreseeable future football is also way more rare than baseball in that era among the first black players to sign with the nba was sweetwater clifton who was nicknamed nat and came into the league in 1950 the same year as earl lloyd and chuck cooper another player harold hunter was drafted and signed a contract in 1950 but was cut before the season clifton signed with the knicks in 1950 from the harlem globetrotters and his rookie card is the 1957 topps this set is notoriously beset with centering and print issues its also extremely rare and thus hard to price given the lack of sales in any grade i have a way to calculate this more broadly using prices across any grade and im getting about 400 appreciation over five years a centered 5 with overall eye appeal is about 475 clifton is in the hall of fame the card is well photographed too i have it on my personal buy list lloyd who also has a card in the 1957 set was the first of the trio to play a regular season nba game i bought this psa 3 this month for 124 in an auction i only have data for the card since 2021 but it is down about 60 that makes no sense lloyd is in the hall of fame and was a solid player i think this card is the biggest value in the hobby now it should be up 300 minimum so even if this was just a 100 card in 2018 i cant find prices going back that far that would be 300 now cooper does not have a card advertisement neither does willie oree the first black player in the nhl who was from canada and played for 20 years though scantly in boxing johnson is widely known as the first black world heavyweight champion and really the first black sports celebrity and target of virulent racism for demolishing white boxers and dating white women at my first show after getting back into the hobby in 2016 the 1910 jack johnson side face in a centered psa 35 was the first card i bought for 90 i figured it had to be a steal when i got home and looked it up they were selling for 60 i felt like a had 30 stolen from me that was a 50 loss but subjectively that price made no sense to me how could a figure as iconic in a wellconditioned card from 1910 have a card of such little value fast forward to today the card is worth about 350 in that condition and one i would recommend buying at that price still so even at what seemed like a high price at the time its nearly a 400 return 600 at market price in 2016 its never timing the market at the right price rather you need to buy the right cards that are likely to retain demand thats higher than the supply all my horrible buys when i started are great buys today because i bought the right cards iconic hall of famers rookies figures like johnson go deeper nike nba city edition 202324 every alternate jersey ranked from no 30 to no 1 photo

just look at the instant money right now when it comes to a deal like is there an opportunity for an equity piece for the athlete or the influencer that now we see theres tons of guys out there whether its steph curry and under armorthat has some equity in it i mean you saw the 50 cents and vitamin waters like it all stemmed i believe from that michael jordan concept and i think it was

Amir Johnson,"Former Celtic Amir Johnson isn’t playing in the NBA now, but his contributions are notable",https://www.bostonglobe.com/2022/03/19/sports/former-celtic-amir-johnson-isnt-playing-nba-now-his-contributions-are-notable/,its been three years since amir johnson donned an nba uniform yet his contributions to the league remain relevant and strong the 34yearold longtime nba veteran signed with the g league ignite club a group of nba prospects many of whom are on 500000 contracts following high school as a means to prepare for the draft nba lottery picks jalen green rockets and jonathan kuminga warriors were drafted after one season with the ignite with johnson as their mentor johnson wants to serve as the old head on the ignite the veteran presence who can teach aspiring nba players how to be a professional nearly two decades ago johnson entered the draft out of westchester los angeles high school the final preptopros class he played 12 seasons and parts of two others with the pistons raptors celtics and 76ers and he found playing with the ignite as a means to remain in the game and pass along his knowledge the ignite played against the cleveland charge during allstar weekend and johnson and his teammates played at cleveland state just hours before the allstar game giving the young guys exposure to the allstar atmosphere as they begin their trek to the highest level advertisement times like this you have to just experience it because you might not get to come here anymore johnson told the globe i tell the youngins to take it all in this is the highest level of basketball and you get to see it and its dope and im happy for them johnson knows he may never get back to the nba but he wanted to teach and still has the skills to play he averaged 85 points and 33 rebounds as a backup center for the ignite but hes an asset to the coaching staff because of his vast experience and knowledge especially of defense its perfect for me to be here because i was in the same position as these guys he said i just have a lot of sayso just from experience for me to be here with these young guys coming out of high school at 18 and they get to come here first to get some learning experience and then go its amazing because when i went everybody in the nba was like 30 and up now you get some vets on this team and they get to learn and then go in the fire advertisement johnson who last played for the 76ers in 2019 didnt want to just go home and chill with his kids hes only 34 he was in the unusual position of being too young to give up the game but not a real consideration for an nba contract the gleague was the ideal landing spot it was just a nobrainer for me to be here he said its good seeing guys like jalen green and jonathan kuminga thrive and play at the next level just cant wait for the next guys to be up and see what they can do but why the gleague isnt glamourous many games are in smaller arenas with no fanfare its mainly a training ground for prospects many players who are advanced in their careers play there for the adoration of the game with little chance of even a 10day nba contract maybe i have another calling for coaching but i love the game and want to be around it he said i still have that itch to go out there and hoop and i feel like i can talk to guys more when im actually on the court and playing i asked scoot henderson is it easier when im on the court talking to you on defense he was like yes johnson who played two seasons with the celtics and was a member of the eastern conference finals team in 2017 was a defensive stalwart screensetter and rebounder he refined a skill set that made him a valuable commodity in the league for years advertisement theres certain stuff i know playing the game he said i tell them ive been in the league 15 years made close to 100 million and i averaged 6 points in the nba even if they dont know my career i tell them i wasnt a superstar but i always did the little things what make teams win games are the little things if you can make someone else better on that team that makes a great teammate and i totally agree with them the thunder has nick collisons jersey retired and he wasnt a top 50 guy he was just a solid dude that set screens good person around the community guys like that can last a long way in the league you just have to find that niche and find what works when youre on a team like golden state youre going to have to learn how to play defense how to gel with a team i think they are learning it just takes repetition johnson said he is telling the prospects such as henderson jaden hardy and michael foster jr about life off the floor the nba life is not easy there is sudden wealth family pressure the night life take your mind off getting paid getting minutes go have fun go play basketball and go learn he said he tells his young teammates listen to what people have to say thats been doing it once that carries on it doesnt matter if one person or 50000 people are in the crowd youre going to focus on the task at hand which is play basketball and play the right way advertisement johnson earned 35 million in the final three full seasons of his nba career he said he allowed his mother to handle his financial affairs when he came into the league at 18 but hes urging his ignite teammates to take more control of their finances take more responsibility for their livelihood instead of just being ballers there are too many cases of nba players blowing their money or losing their riches because of frivolous spending or failed investments johnson said adulthood begins for these prospects the moment they became professionals i tell these guys when theyre dealing with family show youre family that youre a man now he said speak up and say your opinion and tell them whats on your mind let them know communicate whats going on theres a lot that comes with this life you want to know everybodys thats working for you their name how much youre paying them i always ask them whos your agent how much you paying them i didnt know at first i had to learn the business side because at first i let my mom do it you want to jump into that early because you know whats going on eventually your mom is going to have to get out of your business and youre going to have to handle it yourself ask questions check your money because some of the top players you love been taken advantage of johnsons chances of an nba return are miniscule when teams were allowed to sign players to 10day hardship contracts because of covid19 several gleague veterans got calls johnson didnt advertisement if it comes around i definitely wouldnt mind he said if a team needs my services i certainly know what to do to help a team out i certainly wouldnt come and mess up what an organizations got going i would blend right in because i know what to do with certain teams on the come up thats been the story of my career going to toronto starting up when chris bosh left and to boston when the big three left trying to get to the playoffs i know how to be a good teammate johnson said he has aspirations to coach and he has received just as much knowledge from the experience as he has given im learning a lot about the coaching part he said im learning to use my knowledge i have to teach guys certain stuff i teach them how to play basketball move the ball and set screens just certain things that ive done and tricks i learned from rasheed wallace a lot of the stuff we learned from the vets and i just pass it on still the travel takes johnson away from his family he could be home living comfortably and being retired instead hes grinding against santa cruz and sioux falls but he loves that life the family wants me home i aint going to lie to you but they have an understanding he said they know i have a passion for it family were always going to figure it out theyre always going to have my best intentions and my back im going to play until i cant go no more it keeps me in shape it keeps me busy keeps me involved i dont want to just disappear and then what happened to amir but i want to stay in the groove so people know i love the game and i want to learn a different side seeing these guys get drafted is like a championship to me i got to experience playing with them thats my championship right there jaylen brown remains a sneaker free agent which is a big deal in todays nba circles browns deal with adidas expired in 2021 and he has been rocking several types of shoes in games this season brown is taking the decision seriously as he does with every other career decision the enjoyable part for brown is choosing which shoe to wear for each game one day it could be nikes then new balances then perhaps under armour or converse yeah i feel free i feel free brown said i think thats how things have been over the last i dont know how long youve got to rock one brand and stick with it but its a new day and age and me and my whole brand is different were trying to shift the mold of the athlete and the way things are done so for me im enjoying my freedom right now and well see what happens down the line brown said he has had negotiations with competing shoe companies but nothing to his preference ive had numerous conversations with people and everything kind of tends to be the same brown said fit this athlete in this slot and if its not him then well fit another athlete into that slot you really dont get nothing out of it so for me ive been trying to push for some type of individualism you know what i mean if you want to sign jaylen you have to look at what i do off the court as well and try to magnify that platform as well whether its my foundation whether its social activism charity whatever that needs to be included these brands they talk but they dont want to include anything that i want to do off the court it sounds good but when it really comes down to it they dont really care brown has created his own 7uice foundation and clothing line and when asked if he could consider creating his own sneaker similar to former nba player stephon marbury he was intrigued i keep an open mind he said smiling its an idea that you think about but right now im still in the midst of seeing if somebody cares about what goes on outside of basketball and right now nobody does my own shoe might be something thats part of the plan well see several other shoe companies have approached brown a rising talent about his services but the decision is not simple its far more than just wearing cool sneakers on a nightly basis or filming commercials over the course of this season ive had some meetings some talks and my team has went back and forth and discussed and argued he said its been dope because a lot of people they just see what you do on the court and then off the court they dont understand how that whole world works as well how hard it is to have a platform that stands for something and at the same time have endorsements thats a conversation that doesnt exist theyd rather you just be noncontroversial smile dont say anything because its safe all the athletes that i admire theyre not that muhammad ali jim brown kareem abduljabbar the greats that i admire were outspoken and stood for something its interesting to see they try to push the athlete to do the opposite the hawks are expected to be without power forward john collins for the rest of the regular season with a right foot issue and a fractured finger that means atlanta will have a more difficult time avoiding the 10th and final playoff spot and having to win two games to get into the main playoff tournament the hawks made an improbable run to the eastern conference finals last season behind the heroics of trae young and a strong young supporting cast this first full season under nate mcmillan has not worked out as expected and the hawks are going to be part of the playin session with three weeks left in the regular season the wizards despite a seasonending injury to bradley beal were in the running for the playin until a west coast trip swoon russell westbrook may not be a laker next season but hes going to be on somebodys payroll with a 47 million option the final year of that extension he signed with the oklahoma city thunder westbrook has experienced a miserable season and taken most of the blame for the lakers disappointing season westbrooks offensive numbers arent as ghastly as they seem this season westbrooks misses airballs and balls off the backboard have been magnified and hes become a liability on offense because of his inability to shoot the 3pointer opposing teams are leaving westbrook wide open and he is still only a 277 percent shooter from beyond the arc his wellchronicled issues with patrick beverley made headlines again this week when beverley was calling westbrook trash to the lakers sideline while karlanthony towns rebounded a westbrook air ball and made a joking gesture as if there was a breeze in the target center the lakers and westbrook just havent worked out and they could have moved him back to houston for john wall who hasnt played this season and has a contract that matches westbrook but los angeles did not want to relinquish a firstround pick in the deal the rebuilding rockets are content to allow walls contract to expire and continue their youth movement the lakers are going to have to start winning to earn a spot in the playin tournament they entered friday 2 games ahead of the spurs of the lakers final 13 games nine are on the road and 11 are against teams in playoff contention or fighting for

Cade Cunningham,Should the Pistons Expect Cade Cunningham's Recent Play to Be Sustainable?,https://www.givemesport.com/should-the-pistons-expect-cade-cunninghams-recent-play-to-be-sustainable/,your changes have been saved email is sent email has already been sent please verify your email address youve reached your account maximum for followed topics with the detroit pistons now 32 in their last five games the teams young core appears to be turning a corner not just in their ability to win games but to put their own game together as a group no player on the team exemplifies that more than cade cunningham averaging 258 points and 86 assists per game over his last five games while shooting 395 percent from deep cunningham has been the pistons best player and then some however is his recent play sustainable on the surface of cunninghams recent play theres nothing that hes doing during this stretch thats much different than what hes done throughout his nba career the threelevel scoring tough shotmaking transition playmaking and ripthroughs on his way to the rim are staples of his game however cunningham has been more efficient than normal particularly on shots from beyond the arc this could be due to cunningham being more prone to taking what the defense gives him instead of forcing the issue as a player who idolized lebron james this makes sense one of the more unreasonable criticisms against james is that he would rather make the right play than force the issue of course as the best player and top perimeter scoring talent the right play may sometimes be to force the issue nonetheless this heady style of play has led to tremendous success for james and it appears that cunningham is taking a page out of the 20time allstars book to that point far more of cunninghams 3point attempts during the last five games have been of the wide open variety no defender within six feet on the season 178 percent of his threepoint attempts qualified as wide open of which he made 424 percent but over the last five games 220 percent of his shot attempts have been wide open threepointers of which hes made 500 percent cunningham is also getting threepointers out of his hands quicker on the season 200 percent of his attempts from deep come out of his hands within two seconds and he converts 367 percent of those over the last five games 305 percent of these attempts have come out of his hands within two seconds and hes converted 360 percent of those on the season his threepoint efficiency falls to 260 percent when he holds the ball for 26 seconds 250 percent over the last five games cade cunningham shifting his shot profile type last 5 games 202324 season 55 games 3pa wide open 220 178 3pa touch time 2 seconds 305 200 3p above break 3s 438 366 3p 24 feet away 405 366 there are two areas in which the question of sustainability looms though not general efficiency at least for now first cunningham is shooting 438 percent on above the break threepoint attempts over the last five games yet he shoots 366 percent from that area of the floor over the 55 games that hes played this season second cunningham has made 405 percent of his attempts from 24feet and out over the last five games hes been efficient with those long bombs all season but less so as hes also shooting 366 percent on those attempts over 55 games production has never been a question for cunningham as hes long been one of the most instinctual scorers and wellrounded basketball players in the country a player that received his college offer from oklahoma state as a freshman on the varsity team at bowie high school cunningham is somewhere between a prodigy and a gym rat in that way he also resembles james a player whose natural talent has always been apparent but still worked hard to become even greater at just 15 his freshman season at bowie cunningham was already becoming a highly touted prospect as the teams secondleading scorer he went on to earn district 46a honors as the newcomer of the year the next year he earned district 46a comvp honors after averaging 188 points 82 rebounds and 53 assists per game the year after that he earned nike eybl allatlanta mvp honors while playing for the texas titans in 2019 averaging 251 points 66 rebounds and 52 assists per game by the time he left montverde academy where he transferred prior to his junior season he was named 2020 naismith prep player of the year 2020 florida gatorade player of the year and 2020 mr basketball usa cunningham was the topranked point guard and ranked second nationally behind eventual houston rockets shooting guard jalen green on the international stage cunningham was being compared to current dallas mavericks star and former euroleague sensation luka doncic this was right around the same time that cunningham was a major reason why team usa managed a gold medal victory in the 2019 u19 fiba world cup playing alongside a number of future pros just as he did at

2nd spg 14 t6th his oneanddone season with the cowboys would be his magnum opus after averaging 201 points 62 rebounds 35 assists and 16 steals per game while shooting 400 percent from 3 he earned several honors cunninghams collegiate accolades included nabc freshman of the year big 12 player of the year and consensus allamerican first team cunningham was then selected as the no 1 pick in the

vision and the ideal intangibles showing all the hallmarks of a future allstar cunningham has completely taken over for the pistons this makes his selection as the top pick in the 2021 nba draft one of the franchises best decisions in years more than that it was their most important draft decision since selecting andre drummond with the ninth overall pick in the 2012 nba draft drummond would spend eight seasons with the pistons and put up impressive numbers however the former franchise cornerstone only reached the nba playoffs twice while in detroit on top of that in at least one of those instances the pistons were led there by another player whether cunningham will have a similar fate with detroit is unknown as his story is yet to be written all that can be said for now is that he has the keys to take the pistons across the finish line as they attempt to build their first true championship contender since 2004 the detroit pistons rebuild has not gone smoothly but they possess a

Jonathan Taylor,The Phone Call Jonathan Taylor Thomas And His TV Mom Patricia Richardson Had After Tim Allen Said There Had Been Home Improvement Reboot Discussions,https://www.cinemablend.com/television/phone-call-jonathan-taylor-thomas-patricia-richardson-had-tim-allen-home-improvement-reboot,well this is awkward when you purchase through links on our site we may earn an affiliate commission heres how it works hollywood is going through a bit of a rebootrevivalspinoff phase right now which has seen more than a few beloved tv series make comebacks one thats yet to do that is home improvement the tim allenled family sitcom that aired for eight seasons on abc in the 90s nevertheless allen has been talking about plans to bring back the beloved series for some time now at one point he even claimed that the purported production could indeed become a reality and that his former castmates were all up for it however fresh comments shared by his onscreen wife patricia richardson refute that claim she also opened up about a phone call she had with another costar jonathan taylor thomas after allen made the claims patricia richardson played the role of jillian jill taylor for the entire duration of his run from 1991 to 1999 as she explained during her recent appearance on the back to the best podcast the work wasnt always easy due to creative clashes early on or contract negotiations however she seems to have a genuine level of affection for the show that being said the 73yearold actress revealed that she was taken aback when tim allen who played tim taylor on the sitcom announced that a reboot of sorts was being considered with the cast aiming to return richardsons confusion ultimately led her to call her onscreen son jonathan taylor thomas and on the podcast she recalled how that chat played out it was so weird i would hear on twitter or whatever id hear that he was coming out publicly and saying this stuff about everyone was on board to do a home improvement reunion but he never asked me and he never asked jonathan taylor thomas who i talk to so i called jonathan one day and i said has he asked you about this he went no so why is he saying everyone is on board when he hasnt talked to you or me i think thats weird if im being honest i would also find it weird if i were an actor and a former costar were talking up a theoretical project and saying im involved and in reality im not id imagine that the chat patricia richardson and now42yearold jonathan taylor thomas had was a bit awkward however it sounds like the two were of one accord in a clip from the podcast that was shared to youtube richardson went on to say that home improvements leading man made a claim about another spinoff which supposedly involved her character and then there started being this rumor going around that somebody had a script that was like a jill script jills dream or something like that and allen was kind of lying to people and telling them that i was on board and i didnt know anything about it so i wrote a big thing on twitter and said im not involved in any series with jill and also never even been asked to do another home improvement reunion thing but i wouldnt want to the story behind wilson always hiding his face behind the fence on home improvement we of course cant speak to tim allens rationale when making such statements but what can be said is that the 70yearold comedian has been hyped about bringing the taylor family back in 2020 allen discussed a home improvement revival that would theoretically bring back the cast and at that time he said that all the actors think its a great idea he shared another hi spinoff idea in late 2023 which would focus on the children of tim and jill taylors three sons mark randy and brad when discussing a theoretical title he coined the moniker home reimprovement surely there are plenty of fans who would love to see what the tool time host as well as his friends and family are up to now however patricia richardson doesnt think such a series would work for a few reasons i mean zachery ty bryan is now a felon taran noah smith hasnt acted since he left the show hes not an actor anymore and jonathans not really interested in acting he wants to direct and write and we dont have wilson so if they did it without earl hindman and also we just have two kids you know probably if that its not going to be the show at all and people think we can just magically go right back to who we were 30 years ago and do a show that was 30 years ago and weve all changed quite a bit i think shes certainly correct in saying that a reboot would look very different from the og series on paper its hard to say for sure whether it truly would or wouldnt work regardless the chances of it actually happening are probably slim though especially since tim allen is headed back to tv for a new show on abc called shifting gears as the actor recently stated hes geeked about getting a third chance at a sitcom so with that in mind im not sure patricia richardson or jonathan taylor thomas will be getting official calls from abc or their former costar in regards to a home improvement reboot nevertheless based on richardsons comments shes fine with the og show standing on its own and thomas wants to get into directing hopefully both get the opportunities they desire as their former scene partner gets his all the while you can still stream all eight seasons of the classic 90s sitcom using a disney subscription your daily blend of

although she signed nil deals in college with gatorade state farm and recently with wilson as a pro however many in the wnba still compete in other countries to supplement their income given the 2024 veteran super maximum is 241000 the nba has broadcast rights that generate more than 20 billion in revenue and the 2023 top draft pick victor wembanyama earned 121 million in his rookie season with san antonio the nba minimum salary is 11 million with golden states steph curry the top earner at 519 million this year bird spoke with the associated press during the recent business of womens sports summit in new york city on several topics her comments have been edited for clarity and brevity bird if im being honest weve done our part as players the product on the floor has never been better now its the media rights deal its on corporate sponsors to continue to show up and view us as an investment but once we see this media rights deal assuming its going to be what we all think its going to be youre going to see things dramatically change in the wnba it will be a whole new world we have a hard salary cap somewhere in the 14 million range but once the money gets interjected and maybe theres a soft cap now were talking the media rights contract is up this year the cba has an opt out next year so by 2026 it could be dramatically different bird i think long term you want the wnba to be thriving in a way where people feel like they dont have to go overseas but i do still see overseas as a viable option for players who want to continue to play in their offseason and get paid a lot of money even if there was a g league the money would still be better overseas bird i love nil i know its complicated in terms of figuring it out the ways in which schools participate in it collectives and deals to me its just growing pains im sure there will be some rule changes as they go but it will all settle kids coming into college have access to the greatest marketing machine in the world the ncaa tournament and being on espn theres a popularity and youre connecting with a brand theres no better example than caitlin clark who signed a deal with nike in college and look who followed her to the pros it impacts the whole ecosystem in a wonderful way bird just being able to do what i want its nice to not have to worry that i have to eat by 4 pm because my game is at 7 pm they see us hanging out on the couch watching the game and thats exactly what wed be doing if we were at home with no cameras were trying to get a bigger piece of the pie in terms of coverage having women cover the sport and former athletes cover the sport bird we want to shine a light on those that normally dont get it women women of color theyre so important and crucial to the backbone of all

winning",https://theathletic.com/2885337/2021/10/15/the-flyest-aau-team-antonio-davis-as-coach-ken-griffey-jr-s-daughter-two-wnba-finals-players-and-a-whole-lot-of-winning/,editors note this story is included in the athletics best of 2021 view the full list clapclapclap yup clapclapclap yup ahh the familiar sound in aau gyms all over the country as soulja boys donk rang out while the clock wound down in warmups it was 2007 i was 12 years old and preparing to play my first aau game as a member of the georgia ice clapclapclap nope clapclap clap nope my aau team had remixed the smash hit to let our opponents know as regulation ended and we were locking up yet another victory that we were not some random team to be taken lightly advertisement i walked out to the parking lot with my parents after the game to see our opponents angrily shoving their keys into ignitions and driving off whoa i thought theyre old enough to drive we had beaten a u17 team in our first action together and thats when i knew this team was very different it was the start of my youth basketball career with several future wnba players who just happened to be the daughters of superstar professional athletes baseball greats ken griffey jr and delino deshields and nba stars like dee brown antonio davis and kevin whitted along with a slew of other former division i athletes had children on my aau teams destined to follow in their athletic footsteps my dad he was a paralegal we were regular tweens who had silly sleepovers the difference those were sometimes hosted at the griffeys massive mansion we flew first class to an aau championship we came from different backgrounds but we fit well together and we made up the flyest aau girls basketball team around years later its lexie brown and diamond deshields who have most closely followed in their dads athletic footsteps theyre teammates again with the chicago sky playing in the wnba finals against the phoenix mercury time just kind of separates you diamond said when we caught up recently we went to college and then life happens and so being here now i think it reminds us both how much we need each other how it started how its going pictwittercomeb4fqship1 lexie brown lexiebrown june 3 2021 i dont know why all of a sudden the universe brought us back together but without us building our relationship back then i probably wouldnt be on this team right now lexie said in the winter of 2007 i was warming up to play for st pius x catholic high school in metro atlanta when a tall lanky 6footsomething girl walked into the gym with her muchtaller muchlankier father i didnt pay it too much mind just barely 5foot everyone was taller than me what i didnt expect though was having to guard her advertisement i did my best and held my own which was apparently enough for a postgame handshake from the lanky point guard and her proud papa id learn that the girl was kaela davis and that her father was former nba player antonio davis they had moved from chicago to atlanta and were looking to start an aau team my family and i drove back home freaking out i had always been a scrappy little something but i never imagined catching the eye of an nba player even though my team had been defeated no one in the gym could deny that the smallest person on the court was at least the second best player that day i actually didnt want to coach at all just because im not good at cutting kids davis told me when we caught up this week but it was right around the time i was retiring so everything kind of fell into place at the tryout i noticed everybody was so tall and i wasnt which was normal but these girls were all really tall coach antonio put us through one of the most intense workouts id ever been through my dad was there with me he had coached my former aau team before that team split up i made it through the workout holding my own against undoubtedly the best girls my age in the state of georgia davis called my parents a couple days later asking if i would like to be a member of the georgia ice his new girls basketball team i remember jumping on google maybe on my ipod touch and typing antonio davis whoa he played for the bulls and pacers he played against no way michael jordan welcome to the space jam must have been playing in my mind that movie was the reason i started playing basketball now im a degree of separation from jordan davis invited the team to his house to get to know each other i use the term house loosely a movie theater a game room a pool a basketball court the elevator was the thing that blew my mind i had never seen anything like it advertisement before i knew it i was over there pretty often it was the coolest thing ever to me and our team was talented in equal measure one of our first tournaments was at georgia tech we all arrived at the gym early to change into our bright orange and light blue uniforms georgia ice we were the first aau team that i remember to wear nike elite socks we had our names on the back of our jerseys our numbers on the sides of our shoes we qualified for the national championships pretty early in the aau season my family and i had never flown before davis bought the entire team firstclass tickets we were a bunch of 12yearold girls in first class having the time of our lives on an nba superstars dime we won the 12u national championship in 2008 i was really just looking for girls with raw talent to teach them to play the right way davis said i always wanted to practice more than i wanted to play but we just ended up getting really good things got really interesting the next year every girl playing basketball in the area at the time wanted to play for the georgia ice i was about 1000 times more nervous at this tryout and boy were there some superstars in the gym kaela davis anthonys daughter lexie brown dees daughter taryn griffey kens daughter diamond deshields delinos daughter the fact that so many famous fathers had come together to form this girldad super team was unheard of at the time this was pregirl dad era but they learned from an early age about teamwork and work ethic i think the vibe that we put out really just attracted more dads and daughters who really wanted to learn how to play the game the right way davis said the craziest thing for me was that ken griffey jrs dee browns and others of the world trusted me with their daughters and this process lexie and kaela grew up together when davis and dee brown played together for the toronto raptors lexie and taryn griffey later played on the same aau team in orlando while we were forming the georgia ice in atlanta their moms became friends and the girls played on the same team meaning lexie and taryn attended school in orlando during the week and then drove or flew to atlanta on the weekends to compete with the georgia ice advertisement diamond on the other hand was like me her aau team had disbanded and she was looking for an aau home we had played against each other several times growing up our teams had a bit of an u11 rivalry if there was such a thing at that age at that point i knew who i wanted to play with i said im going to play with them diamond said brown called the georgia ice a super team none of that was actually planned davis said when we had the opportunity to add someone like diamond deshields i didnt know if she was going to be a good fit i knew she was extremely athletic and had all the tools i just didnt know if she was going to mesh with our team but each and every girl that came our way just ended up being the perfect piece wed grow together as a team and as young women over the course of that season under the guidance of the goat dads having davis lead us reminded me a lot of when my dad coached me but i often wondered how it was to have a superstar dad and to have to perform in front of him it formed a bond among players for me just the fact that kaela lexie peyton whitted and taryn all had parents who were pros diamond said i got to interact with kids that kind of grew up the same way as i did in that aspect it was cool lexie said i think thats why me and diamond have been able to bond and stay close over the years because we have very similar upbringings and we can appreciate that about each other those sleepovers though were something in our second year together the aau national championships were conveniently held in orlando where taryn and lexie lived while our parents went back to their hotel rooms after games the whole team spent the weekend at the griffeys house i remember one couch so big all 15 of us slept on it comfortably advertisement sometimes wed be in hotel lobbies after games and the dads traded stories from griffeys greatest hits to davis time playing against jordan my family would sit in awe in time we all grew pretty close it just became like a family lexie said wed spend our time watching the youtube videos that were going viral at the time we liked to create our own content back then before it was trendy we were doing viral shit before viral was a thing said deshields in the summer of 2009 we traveled to virginia for the boo williams invitational as the starting point guard i suffered an acl injury that lexie says changed the course of her career giving her more time at the position i dont know if i can agree with that given her talent it was diamonds coming out party for us for sure said lexie every d1 womens basketball coach you could think of lined the sidelines to watch us work the greatest show on ice as we were called was as popular as it had ever been coming off of two aau national championships and garnering elitelevel college looks olympic gold medalist allisha gray eventually joined the team as well the good times would eventually end as they always have to wed all go on to focus on playing for our high school teams i went to collins hill high school and had the pleasure of getting my brains beat in over the next four years by diamond at norcross high and lexie at north gwinnett we began to compete against each other more than we played together priorities became different for some i for example was now quite certain that i was not going to play professionally and was just hoping to secure a scholarship i eventually signed to play division ii basketball at the university of montevallo in alabama lexie committed to maryland diamond to north carolina kaela and allisha to south carolina peyton whitted to penn state kristina nelson to notre dame and kylee smith to belmont advertisement from there life did its thing lexie transferred to duke to finish diamond to tennessee kaela and allisha won a national championship with dawn staley i transferred to the university of west georgia allison was drafted fourth in 2017 by the dallas wings kaela went to dallas as well a few picks later at no 10 diamond was drafted no 3 overall by the chicago sky in 2018 lexie would be a few picks behind at no 9 to the connecticut sun after playing in hungary for a season lexie was traded to the minnesota lynx where she played a significant role coming off of the bench for two seasons before injuries slowed her momentum heading into the bubble lexie was waived by chicago after training camp earlier this season before she was brought back and signed permanently she said her rekindled friendship with diamond helped her feel comfortable joining the sky yeah getting to chicago for me was like a hot ass mess she said you know me and diamonds relationship actually wasnt the greatest in college i was out of the league this year for three weeks so its really hard to get in its even harder to stay in having the relationships with the right people and you have to carry yourself professionally you can find a way back and diamond was a huge part of that if you told us we would be finishing a wnba season togetherwe wouldnt have even believed it pictwittercomhchwpsm6yr lexie brown lexiebrown september 19 2021 they played for different teams in the wubble last season and didnt talk when diamond suffered an injury lexies mom encouraged her to reach out my mom was just like i think she needs you back in her life brown said i was like nah shes fine but i invited her over for thanksgiving i was still with minnesota at the time but i was already feeling weird about that situation she was like yeah you should just come play with us in chicago james loves your game and i would love for you to be there advertisement lexie felt comfortable in minnesota at the time but had diamond put in a good word with chicago lexie and the lynx eventually parted ways at the end of 2020 chicago was the first team that called my agent she said they were trying to trade for me during free agency and they just couldnt i think that everything was a blessing in disguise even as kids winning titles together lexie and diamond didnt dream about playing for a professional championship being this close now to possibly getting to the wnba finals together which is a conversation neither one of us have ever had together lexie said chicago the no 6 seed is in the finals for the first time since 2014 the sky play game 3 friday in chicago with the series against phoenix tied 11 the possibility of winning a championship together as adults now becomes more real every day for both lexie and diamond even when diamond was a little younger she had doubts lexie says she had selfdoubt about her even getting to the wnba that was a shocking revelation to me i remember when we all walked into the gym at 13 years old and thinking wow these guys are going to the league and i am not we had played against each other for so long but i dont ever remember diamond being a noname so when she came in i already knew she was like that seeing them achieve all these years later makes our childhood memories all the sweeter looking back we were good teen players now we see it as the start of successful basketball careers for some i know when i walked in i was like oh this is a different level of tough diamond said like oh man im going to take what i can here deshields said i thought everybody was just equally tough i just saw everybody as an equal at that point i felt like we were all the best 13yearolds on the planet looking back i think we were photo courtesy of lexie brown get allaccess to exclusive stories

Lexie Brown,"The flyest AAU team: Antonio Davis as coach, Ken Griffey Jr.'s daughter, two WNBA Finals players and a whole lot of winning",https://theathletic.com/2885337/2021/10/15/the-flyest-aau-team-antonio-davis-as-coach-ken-griffey-jr-s-daughter-two-wnba-finals-players-and-a-whole-lot-of-winning/,editors note this story is included in the athletics best of 2021 view the full list clapclapclap yup clapclapclap yup ahh the familiar sound in aau gyms all over the country as soulja boys donk rang out while the clock wound down in warmups it was 2007 i was 12 years old and preparing to play my first aau game as a member of the georgia ice clapclapclap nope clapclap clap nope my aau team had remixed the smash hit to let our opponents know as regulation ended and we were locking up yet another victory that we were not some random team to be taken lightly advertisement i walked out to the parking lot with my parents after the game to see our opponents angrily shoving their keys into ignitions and driving off whoa i thought theyre old enough to drive we had beaten a u17 team in our first action together and thats when i knew this team was very different it was the start of my youth basketball career with several future wnba players who just happened to be the daughters of superstar professional athletes baseball greats ken griffey jr and delino deshields and nba stars like dee brown antonio davis and kevin whitted along with a slew of other former division i athletes had children on my aau teams destined to follow in their athletic footsteps my dad he was a paralegal we were regular tweens who had silly sleepovers the difference those were sometimes hosted at the griffeys massive mansion we flew first class to an aau championship we came from different backgrounds but we fit well together and we made up the flyest aau girls basketball team around years later its lexie brown and diamond deshields who have most closely followed in their dads athletic footsteps theyre teammates again with the chicago sky playing in the wnba finals against the phoenix mercury time just kind of separates you diamond said when we caught up recently we went to college and then life happens and so being here now i think it reminds us both how much we need each other how it started how its going pictwittercomeb4fqship1 lexie brown lexiebrown june 3 2021 i dont know why all of a sudden the universe brought us back together but without us building our relationship back then i probably wouldnt be on this team right now lexie said in the winter of 2007 i was warming up to play for st pius x catholic high school in metro atlanta when a tall lanky 6footsomething girl walked into the gym with her muchtaller muchlankier father i didnt pay it too much mind just barely 5foot everyone was taller than me what i didnt expect though was having to guard her advertisement i did my best and held my own which was apparently enough for a postgame handshake from the lanky point guard and her proud papa id learn that the girl was kaela davis and that her father was former nba player antonio davis they had moved from chicago to atlanta and were looking to start an aau team my family and i drove back home freaking out i had always been a scrappy little something but i never imagined catching the eye of an nba player even though my team had been defeated no one in the gym could deny that the smallest person on the court was at least the second best player that day i actually didnt want to coach at all just because im not good at cutting kids davis told me when we caught up this week but it was right around the time i was retiring so everything kind of fell into place at the tryout i noticed everybody was so tall and i wasnt which was normal but these girls were all really tall coach antonio put us through one of the most intense workouts id ever been through my dad was there with me he had coached my former aau team before that team split up i made it through the workout holding my own against undoubtedly the best girls my age in the state of georgia davis called my parents a couple days later asking if i would like to be a member of the georgia ice his new girls basketball team i remember jumping on google maybe on my ipod touch and typing antonio davis whoa he played for the bulls and pacers he played against no way michael jordan welcome to the space jam must have been playing in my mind that movie was the reason i started playing basketball now im a degree of separation from jordan davis invited the team to his house to get to know each other i use the term house loosely a movie theater a game room a pool a basketball court the elevator was the thing that blew my mind i had never seen anything like it advertisement before i knew it i was over there pretty often it was the coolest thing ever to me and our team was talented in equal measure one of our first tournaments was at georgia tech we all arrived at the gym early to change into our bright orange and light blue uniforms georgia ice we were the first aau team that i remember to wear nike elite socks we had our names on the back of our jerseys our numbers on the sides of our shoes we qualified for the national championships pretty early in the aau season my family and i had never flown before davis bought the entire team firstclass tickets we were a bunch of 12yearold girls in first class having the time of our lives on an nba superstars dime we won the 12u national championship in 2008 i was really just looking for girls with raw talent to teach them to play the right way davis said i always wanted to practice more than i wanted to play but we just ended up getting really good things got really interesting the next year every girl playing basketball in the area at the time wanted to play for the georgia ice i was about 1000 times more nervous at this tryout and boy were there some superstars in the gym kaela davis anthonys daughter lexie brown dees daughter taryn griffey kens daughter diamond deshields delinos daughter the fact that so many famous fathers had come together to form this girldad super team was unheard of at the time this was pregirl dad era but they learned from an early age about teamwork and work ethic i think the vibe that we put out really just attracted more dads and daughters who really wanted to learn how to play the game the right way davis said the craziest thing for me was that ken griffey jrs dee browns and others of the world trusted me with their daughters and this process lexie and kaela grew up together when davis and dee brown played together for the toronto raptors lexie and taryn griffey later played on the same aau team in orlando while we were forming the georgia ice in atlanta their moms became friends and the girls played on the same team meaning lexie and taryn attended school in orlando during the week and then drove or flew to atlanta on the weekends to compete with the georgia ice advertisement diamond on the other hand was like me her aau team had disbanded and she was looking for an aau home we had played against each other several times growing up our teams had a bit of an u11 rivalry if there was such a thing at that age at that point i knew who i wanted to play with i said im going to play with them diamond said brown called the georgia ice a super team none of that was actually planned davis said when we had the opportunity to add someone like diamond deshields i didnt know if she was going to be a good fit i knew she was extremely athletic and had all the tools i just didnt know if she was going to mesh with our team but each and every girl that came our way just ended up being the perfect piece wed grow together as a team and as young women over the course of that season under the guidance of the goat dads having davis lead us reminded me a lot of when my dad coached me but i often wondered how it was to have a superstar dad and to have to perform in front of him it formed a bond among players for me just the fact that kaela lexie peyton whitted and taryn all had parents who were pros diamond said i got to interact with kids that kind of grew up the same way as i did in that aspect it was cool lexie said i think thats why me and diamond have been able to bond and stay close over the years because we have very similar upbringings and we can appreciate that about each other those sleepovers though were something in our second year together the aau national championships were conveniently held in orlando where taryn and lexie lived while our parents went back to their hotel rooms after games the whole team spent the weekend at the griffeys house i remember one couch so big all 15 of us slept on it comfortably advertisement sometimes wed be in hotel lobbies after games and the dads traded stories from griffeys greatest hits to davis time playing against jordan my family would sit in awe in time we all grew pretty close it just became like a family lexie said wed spend our time watching the youtube videos that were going viral at the time we liked to create our own content back then before it was trendy we were doing viral shit before viral was a thing said deshields in the summer of 2009 we traveled to virginia for the boo williams invitational as the starting point guard i suffered an acl injury that lexie says changed the course of her career giving her more time at the position i dont know if i can agree with that given her talent it was diamonds coming out party for us for sure said lexie every d1 womens basketball coach you could think of lined the sidelines to watch us work the greatest show on ice as we were called was as popular as it had ever been coming off of two aau national championships and garnering elitelevel college looks olympic gold medalist allisha gray eventually joined the team as well the good times would eventually end as they always have to wed all go on to focus on playing for our high school teams i went to collins hill high school and had the pleasure of getting my brains beat in over the next four years by diamond at norcross high and lexie at north gwinnett we began to compete against each other more than we played together priorities became different for some i for example was now quite certain that i was not going to play professionally and was just hoping to secure a scholarship i eventually signed to play division ii basketball at the university of montevallo in alabama lexie committed to maryland diamond to north carolina kaela and allisha to south carolina peyton whitted to penn state kristina nelson to notre dame and kylee smith to belmont advertisement from there life did its thing lexie transferred to duke to finish diamond to tennessee kaela and allisha won a national championship with dawn staley i transferred to the university of west georgia allison was drafted fourth in 2017 by the dallas wings kaela went to dallas as well a few picks later at no 10 diamond was drafted no 3 overall by the chicago sky in 2018 lexie would be a few picks behind at no 9 to the connecticut sun after playing in hungary for a season lexie was traded to the minnesota lynx where she played a significant role coming off of the bench for two seasons before injuries slowed her momentum heading into the bubble lexie was waived by chicago after training camp earlier this season before she was brought back and signed permanently she said her rekindled friendship with diamond helped her feel comfortable joining the sky yeah getting to chicago for me was like a hot ass mess she said you know me and diamonds relationship actually wasnt the greatest in college i was out of the league this year for three weeks so its really hard to get in its even harder to stay in having the relationships with the right people and you have to carry yourself professionally you can find a way back and diamond was a huge part of that if you told us we would be finishing a wnba season togetherwe wouldnt have even believed it pictwittercomhchwpsm6yr lexie brown lexiebrown september 19 2021 they played for different teams in the wubble last season and didnt talk when diamond suffered an injury lexies mom encouraged her to reach out my mom was just like i think she needs you back in her life brown said i was like nah shes fine but i invited her over for thanksgiving i was still with minnesota at the time but i was already feeling weird about that situation she was like yeah you should just come play with us in chicago james loves your game and i would love for you to be there advertisement lexie felt comfortable in minnesota at the time but had diamond put in a good word with chicago lexie and the lynx eventually parted ways at the end of 2020 chicago was the first team that called my agent she said they were trying to trade for me during free agency and they just couldnt i think that everything was a blessing in disguise even as kids winning titles together lexie and diamond didnt dream about playing for a professional championship being this close now to possibly getting to the wnba finals together which is a conversation neither one of us have ever had together lexie said chicago the no 6 seed is in the finals for the first time since 2014 the sky play game 3 friday in chicago with the series against phoenix tied 11 the possibility of winning a championship together as adults now becomes more real every day for both lexie and diamond even when diamond was a little younger she had doubts lexie says she had selfdoubt about her even getting to the wnba that was a shocking revelation to me i remember when we all walked into the gym at 13 years old and thinking wow these guys are going to the league and i am not we had played against each other for so long but i dont ever remember diamond being a noname so when she came in i already knew she was like that seeing them achieve all these years later makes our childhood memories all the sweeter looking back we were good teen players now we see it as the start of successful basketball careers for some i know when i walked in i was like oh this is a different level of tough diamond said like oh man im going to take what i can here deshields said i thought everybody was just equally tough i just saw everybody as an equal at that point i felt like we were all the best 13yearolds on the planet looking back i think we were photo courtesy of lexie brown get allaccess to exclusive stories

Alysha Clark,“Hate for Rookie Class Has to Be Studied”: Fans Turn Skeptical After Caitlin Clark Gets Whacked in the Face by Aces’ Alysha

guard caitlin clark 22 shows frustration thursday may 16 2024 during the indiana fever home opener game against the new york liberty at gainbridge fieldhouse in indianapolis mandatory credit grace hollarsusa today sports is the caitlin clark hate real despite becky hammon sending out a clear message that no one in the league hates clark the game between las vegas aces and indiana fever had a quite a controversial moment during a rather onesided game the reigning sixth player of the year alysha clark inadvertently hit clark hard on the face while trying to block her shot during the initial minutes of the second quarter of the game between indiana and las vegas tonight caitlin clark drove to the basket for a layup but couldnt create enough separation between herself and the defender alysha clark it resulted in the aces guard stripping the ball away from the iowa icon however alysha also smacked the 22yearold in the eye while at first glance it didnt look too dangerous replays suggested otherwise as a result the 3x wnba champion picked a quick whistle for a personal foul and clark went to the strip for a couple of free throws while it did not look anything like an intentional hit the aces guard ran away from the crime scene in disbelief although clark continued playing for the fever the aces prevented the rookie from showing off her skills she only scored 8 points and 5 rebounds with a gamehigh 7 assists advertisement article continues below this ad usa today via reuters may 3 2024 dallas texas usa indiana fever guard caitlin clark 22 reacts during the second half against the dallas wings at college park center mandatory credit kevin jairajusa today sports the game ended with a 9980 win for the aces but the caitlin clark incident became the talking point when she arrived in the league there were rumors that some of the veterans werent happy because of the attention that was given to clark clark generated high viewership numbers during her college career and as such she is expected to do the same in wnba but the physical nature of the league has been quite a challenge as clark and other rookies were preparing for the draft this year wnba legend diana taurasi had a warning for them reality is coming theres levels to this thing you look superhuman playing against some 18 years olds but youre going to come play with some grown women that have been playing professional basketball for a long time clark has realized that the wnba is a step up from college basketball in terms of the physicality on display she has acknowledged the increased physicality and speed after a first few games the physicality is definitely up there im easily pushed off screens the game seems a little fast for me right now so far clark has done alright as she averages 178 points per game and 58 assists but she has struggled with turnovers averaging 58 per game and her shooting percentages have also dipped still in light of what happened with alysha clark in the recent game fans are not happy and believe that there is a deliberate attempt to stifle the rookie class on wnba by the veterans indiana has a very young core that has struggled to keep up with the physicality of the league with six defeats and one win this season however what happened tonight has turned the focus on whether being physical should translate into hurting the opponent one yt user stood up for all the 2024 rookies they commented the hate for this rookie class has to be studied another yt user called out the old players for their behavior towards the rookies tonight caitlin clark was not the only one on the receiving end of the physical nature of the w as angel reese was also thrown to the ground in her game the player of the week in the eastern conference alyssa thomas dragged the rookie down by her neck although the chitown barbie only praised the vet fans are not okay with what is going on against the talented 2024 batch this old players are disgusting happened during sun game too also thomas took down reece by the neck the nba goats have been standing up for caitlin clark ever since she was in college and received attention recently lebron james commented on how the rookie is the sole reason for all the great changes in the w sir charles and magic johnson also followed that up they praised clark for all her contributions to the evolution of the league in fact charles barkley addressed the treatment that has been meted out to clark and called it petty speaking during the tv coverage of nba playoffs barkley said yall petty girls yall should be thanking that girl for getting yall a private charters all the money and visibility shes bringing to the wnba dont be petty like dudes what shes accomplished give her her flowers hence one clark fan brought up how charles barkley had called all the hateful wnba veterans charles barkley stop being petty earlier aces coach said becky hammon said there was no animosity towards clark from the league she said this narrative of everybody hating on caitlin clark and even the black and white thing knock it off its not there its not there shut down the noise but the aysha clark incident does raise a few questions a basketball follower also brought up the fact that after the followthrough hit alysha clark pranced out of the paint and even if the smack was not intentional the way she laughed off of the area made the entire situation look strange later kelsey plum too bent down while trying to hide her laugh after this case so whether it was intended or not we cannot say for sure but did the whistle for a foul make the right decision pretty much so that was a deliberate hit from the way she was prancing afterwards advertisement article continues below this ad parallels between michael jordan and caitlin clark are not new in the w her huge deal with nike and wilson has stirred up the air with comparisons and while none of the players have spoken about it fans are not stopping with it hence one yt user reminded the previously honored stephen curry of womens basketball that she is the mj of the womens league they also told the rookie to know the hate but also to continue raising the bar cc remember this they are hatein on you your mj of this womans leagueso take the hits get in the gym and stay balling girl it wont be surprising to see the ncaa alltime leading scorer getting more such hits in the coming weeks and months next the fever will host the la sparks in their home arena it will be interesting to see if they can hand the visitors another defeat and grab their second win of the season fans will hope that clark will be the talking point of the upcoming match but for all the right reasons advertisement article continues below this ad

against the new york liberty at barclays center mandatory credit wendell cruzusa today sports did team usa drop the ball by ignoring caitlin clarks marketing potential less than 24 hours after team usas mens basketball team handed france a defeat in the finals the womens team did the same they defeated the host nation by a narrow 6766 margin on sunday to claim their eighth consecutive gold at the olympics despite these efforts and achievements stephen a smith believes team usa missed an opportunity and hes not apologetic for saying this on august 13th smith unveiled his perspective via his official youtube channel when you talk about marketing the sport i think team usa missed an opportunity to elevate the profile of womens excellence in the sport of basketball because they ignored marketing he said after applauding team usas women for returning with their eighth consecutive gold around their necks for smith caitlin clark was an opportunity team usa could have seized her addition to team usa would have been a marketing boost box office matters we want to act like it doesnt matter but it does he added for context 4 of team usas games over the past week drew an audience of less than 13000 meanwhile the indiana fever alone recorded about 16898 viewers per game for 11 straight since clarks arrival advertisement article continues below this ad he even pointed out how the mens basketball team is taking advantage of marketing opportunities its not an accident i saw anthony edwards with those adidas shoes or lebron james with his goldplated shoes but i saw that adidas took advantage of the marketing opportunity lebron took advantage of the marketing opportunity it matters he added quite evidently smith seems to be right but how has caitlin clarks omission from team usa affected her did team usa just make the biggest mistake by snubbing caitlin clark react reactions advertisement article continues below this ad well it did affect her but in a good way in fact it turned out to be a blessing in disguise i honestly cant wait to not touch a basketball for a while she told the athletic after the wnba allstar matchup most of the rookies who share similar hype havent had the privilege of a break but clark made the most of the wnbas 24day olympic break vacationing in mexico with her teammates and attending india state fair i think relaxing and reflecting on everything thats happened to me over the course of the last year is going to be super important because my life has moved so fast she added above all she finally got time to relax after march 2023 now that its time to return she might have reanalyzed her wnba rookie season which is extremely important in the rookie of the year race her first game after the olympics break will be against pheonix mercury on 17th august what do you think will she be stronger and better this time advertisement article continues below this ad stay tuned for more such updates and join us for the

Diamond DeShields,"The flyest AAU team: Antonio Davis as coach, Ken Griffey Jr.'s daughter, two WNBA Finals players and a whole lot of winning",https://theathletic.com/2885337/2021/10/15/the-flyest-aau-team-antonio-davis-as-coach-ken-griffey-jr-s-daughter-two-wnba-finals-players-and-a-whole-lot-of-winning/,editors note this story is included in the athletics best of 2021 view the full list clapclapclap yup clapclapclap yup ahh the familiar sound in aau gyms all over the country as soulja boys donk rang out while the clock wound down in warmups it was 2007 i was 12 years old and preparing to play my first aau game as a member of the georgia ice clapclapclap nope clapclap clap nope my aau team had remixed the smash hit to let our opponents know as regulation ended and we were locking up yet another victory that we were not some random team to be taken lightly advertisement i walked out to the parking lot with my parents after the game to see our opponents angrily shoving their keys into ignitions and driving off whoa i thought theyre old enough to drive we had beaten a u17 team in our first action together and thats when i knew this team was very different it was the start of my youth basketball career with several future wnba players who just happened to be the daughters of superstar professional athletes baseball greats ken griffey jr and delino deshields and nba stars like dee brown antonio davis and kevin whitted along with a slew of other former division i athletes had children on my aau teams destined to follow in their athletic footsteps my dad he was a paralegal we were regular tweens who had silly sleepovers the difference those were sometimes hosted at the griffeys massive mansion we flew first class to an aau championship we came from different backgrounds but we fit well together and we made up the flyest aau girls basketball team around years later its lexie brown and diamond deshields who have most closely followed in their dads athletic footsteps theyre teammates again with the chicago sky playing in the wnba finals against the phoenix mercury time just kind of separates you diamond said when we caught up recently we went to college and then life happens and so being here now i think it reminds us both how much we need each other how it started how its going pictwittercomeb4fqship1 lexie brown lexiebrown june 3 2021 i dont know why all of a sudden the universe brought us back together but without us building our relationship back then i probably wouldnt be on this team right now lexie said in the winter of 2007 i was warming up to play for st pius x catholic high school in metro atlanta when a tall lanky 6footsomething girl walked into the gym with her muchtaller muchlankier father i didnt pay it too much mind just barely 5foot everyone was taller than me what i didnt expect though was having to guard her advertisement i did my best and held my own which was apparently enough for a postgame handshake from the lanky point guard and her proud papa id learn that the girl was kaela davis and that her father was former nba player antonio davis they had moved from chicago to atlanta and were looking to start an aau team my family and i drove back home freaking out i had always been a scrappy little something but i never imagined catching the eye of an nba player even though my team had been defeated no one in the gym could deny that the smallest person on the court was at least the second best player that day i actually didnt want to coach at all just because im not good at cutting kids davis told me when we caught up this week but it was right around the time i was retiring so everything kind of fell into place at the tryout i noticed everybody was so tall and i wasnt which was normal but these girls were all really tall coach antonio put us through one of the most intense workouts id ever been through my dad was there with me he had coached my former aau team before that team split up i made it through the workout holding my own against undoubtedly the best girls my age in the state of georgia davis called my parents a couple days later asking if i would like to be a member of the georgia ice his new girls basketball team i remember jumping on google maybe on my ipod touch and typing antonio davis whoa he played for the bulls and pacers he played against no way michael jordan welcome to the space jam must have been playing in my mind that movie was the reason i started playing basketball now im a degree of separation from jordan davis invited the team to his house to get to know each other i use the term house loosely a movie theater a game room a pool a basketball court the elevator was the thing that blew my mind i had never seen anything like it advertisement before i knew it i was over there pretty often it was the coolest thing ever to me and our team was talented in equal measure one of our first tournaments was at georgia tech we all arrived at the gym early to change into our bright orange and light blue uniforms georgia ice we were the first aau team that i remember to wear nike elite socks we had our names on the back of our jerseys our numbers on the sides of our shoes we qualified for the national championships pretty early in the aau season my family and i had never flown before davis bought the entire team firstclass tickets we were a bunch of 12yearold girls in first class having the time of our lives on an nba superstars dime we won the 12u national championship in 2008 i was really just looking for girls with raw talent to teach them to play the right way davis said i always wanted to practice more than i wanted to play but we just ended up getting really good things got really interesting the next year every girl playing basketball in the area at the time wanted to play for the georgia ice i was about 1000 times more nervous at this tryout and boy were there some superstars in the gym kaela davis anthonys daughter lexie brown dees daughter taryn griffey kens daughter diamond deshields delinos daughter the fact that so many famous fathers had come together to form this girldad super team was unheard of at the time this was pregirl dad era but they learned from an early age about teamwork and work ethic i think the vibe that we put out really just attracted more dads and daughters who really wanted to learn how to play the game the right way davis said the craziest thing for me was that ken griffey jrs dee browns and others of the world trusted me with their daughters and this process lexie and kaela grew up together when davis and dee brown played together for the toronto raptors lexie and taryn griffey later played on the same aau team in orlando while we were forming the georgia ice in atlanta their moms became friends and the girls played on the same team meaning lexie and taryn attended school in orlando during the week and then drove or flew to atlanta on the weekends to compete with the georgia ice advertisement diamond on the other hand was like me her aau team had disbanded and she was looking for an aau home we had played against each other several times growing up our teams had a bit of an u11 rivalry if there was such a thing at that age at that point i knew who i wanted to play with i said im going to play with them diamond said brown called the georgia ice a super team none of that was actually planned davis said when we had the opportunity to add someone like diamond deshields i didnt know if she was going to be a good fit i knew she was extremely athletic and had all the tools i just didnt know if she was going to mesh with our team but each and every girl that came our way just ended up being the perfect piece wed grow together as a team and as young women over the course of that season under the guidance of the goat dads having davis lead us reminded me a lot of when my dad coached me but i often wondered how it was to have a superstar dad and to have to perform in front of him it formed a bond among players for me just the fact that kaela lexie peyton whitted and taryn all had parents who were pros diamond said i got to interact with kids that kind of grew up the same way as i did in that aspect it was cool lexie said i think thats why me and diamond have been able to bond and stay close over the years because we have very similar upbringings and we can appreciate that about each other those sleepovers though were something in our second year together the aau national championships were conveniently held in orlando where taryn and lexie lived while our parents went back to their hotel rooms after games the whole team spent the weekend at the griffeys house i remember one couch so big all 15 of us slept on it comfortably advertisement sometimes wed be in hotel lobbies after games and the dads traded stories from griffeys greatest hits to davis time playing against jordan my family would sit in awe in time we all grew pretty close it just became like a family lexie said wed spend our time watching the youtube videos that were going viral at the time we liked to create our own content back then before it was trendy we were doing viral shit before viral was a thing said deshields in the summer of 2009 we traveled to virginia for the boo williams invitational as the starting point guard i suffered an acl injury that lexie says changed the course of her career giving her more time at the position i dont know if i can agree with that given her talent it was diamonds coming out party for us for sure said lexie every d1 womens basketball coach you could think of lined the sidelines to watch us work the greatest show on ice as we were called was as popular as it had ever been coming off of two aau national championships and garnering elitelevel college looks olympic gold medalist allisha gray eventually joined the team as well the good times would eventually end as they always have to wed all go on to focus on playing for our high school teams i went to collins hill high school and had the pleasure of getting my brains beat in over the next four years by diamond at norcross high and lexie at north gwinnett we began to compete against each other more than we played together priorities became different for some i for example was now quite certain that i was not going to play professionally and was just hoping to secure a scholarship i eventually signed to play division ii basketball at the university of montevallo in alabama lexie committed to maryland diamond to north carolina kaela and allisha to south carolina peyton whitted to penn state kristina nelson to notre dame and kylee smith to belmont advertisement from there life did its thing lexie transferred to duke to finish diamond to tennessee kaela and allisha won a national championship with dawn staley i transferred to the university of west georgia allison was drafted fourth in 2017 by the dallas wings kaela went to dallas as well a few picks later at no 10 diamond was drafted no 3 overall by the chicago sky in 2018 lexie would be a few picks behind at no 9 to the connecticut sun after playing in hungary for a season lexie was traded to the minnesota lynx where she played a significant role coming off of the bench for two seasons before injuries slowed her momentum heading into the bubble lexie was waived by chicago after training camp earlier this season before she was brought back and signed permanently she said her rekindled friendship with diamond helped her feel comfortable joining the sky yeah getting to chicago for me was like a hot ass mess she said you know me and diamonds relationship actually wasnt the greatest in college i was out of the league this year for three weeks so its really hard to get in its even harder to stay in having the relationships with the right people and you have to carry yourself professionally you can find a way back and diamond was a huge part of that if you told us we would be finishing a wnba season togetherwe wouldnt have even believed it pictwittercomhchwpsm6yr lexie brown lexiebrown september 19 2021 they played for different teams in the wubble last season and didnt talk when diamond suffered an injury lexies mom encouraged her to reach out my mom was just like i think she needs you back in her life brown said i was like nah shes fine but i invited her over for thanksgiving i was still with minnesota at the time but i was already feeling weird about that situation she was like yeah you should just come play with us in chicago james loves your game and i would love for you to be there advertisement lexie felt comfortable in minnesota at the time but had diamond put in a good word with chicago lexie and the lynx eventually parted ways at the end of 2020 chicago was the first team that called my agent she said they were trying to trade for me during free agency and they just couldnt i think that everything was a blessing in disguise even as kids winning titles together lexie and diamond didnt dream about playing for a professional championship being this close now to possibly getting to the wnba finals together which is a conversation neither one of us have ever had together lexie said chicago the no 6 seed is in the finals for the first time since 2014 the sky play game 3 friday in chicago with the series against phoenix tied 11 the possibility of winning a championship together as adults now becomes more real every day for both lexie and diamond even when diamond was a little younger she had doubts lexie says she had selfdoubt about her even getting to the wnba that was a shocking revelation to me i remember when we all walked into the gym at 13 years old and thinking wow these guys are going to the league and i am not we had played against each other for so long but i dont ever remember diamond being a noname so when she came in i already knew she was like that seeing them achieve all these years later makes our childhood memories all the sweeter looking back we were good teen players now we see it as the start of successful basketball careers for some i know when i walked in i was like oh this is a different level of tough diamond said like oh man im going to take what i can here deshields said i thought everybody was just equally tough i just saw everybody as an equal at that point i felt like we were all the best 13yearolds on the planet looking back i think we were photo courtesy of lexie brown get allaccess to exclusive stories

Diamond DeShields,"The flyest AAU team: Antonio Davis as coach, Ken Griffey Jr.'s daughter, two WNBA Finals players and a whole lot of winning",https://theathletic.com/2885337/2021/10/15/the-flyest-aau-team-antonio-davis-as-coach-ken-griffey-jr-s-daughter-two-wnba-finals-players-and-a-whole-lot-of-winning/,editors note this story is included in the athletics best of 2021 view the full list clapclapclap yup clapclapclap yup ahh the familiar sound in aau gyms all over the country as soulja boys donk rang out while the clock wound down in warmups it was 2007 i was 12 years old and preparing to play my first aau game as a member of the georgia ice clapclapclap nope clapclap clap nope my aau team had remixed the smash hit to let our opponents know as regulation ended and we were locking up yet another victory that we were not some random team to be taken lightly advertisement i walked out to the parking lot with my parents after the game to see our opponents angrily shoving their keys into ignitions and driving off whoa i thought theyre old enough to drive we had beaten a u17 team in our first action together and thats when i knew this team was very different it was the start of my youth basketball career with several future wnba players who just happened to be the daughters of superstar professional athletes baseball greats ken griffey jr and delino deshields and nba stars like dee brown antonio davis and kevin whitted along with a slew of other former division i athletes had children on my aau teams destined to follow in their athletic footsteps my dad he was a paralegal we were regular tweens who had silly sleepovers the difference those were sometimes hosted at the griffeys massive mansion we flew first class to an aau championship we came from different backgrounds but we fit well together and we made up the flyest aau girls basketball team around years later its lexie brown and diamond deshields who have most closely followed in their dads athletic footsteps theyre teammates again with the chicago sky playing in the wnba finals against the phoenix mercury time just kind of separates you diamond said when we caught up recently we went to college and then life happens and so being here now i think it reminds us both how much we need each other how it started how its going pictwittercomeb4fqship1 lexie brown lexiebrown june 3 2021 i dont know why all of a sudden the universe brought us back together but without us building our relationship back then i probably wouldnt be on this team right now lexie said in the winter of 2007 i was warming up to play for st pius x catholic high school in metro atlanta when a tall lanky 6footsomething girl walked into the gym with her muchtaller muchlankier father i didnt pay it too much mind just barely 5foot everyone was taller than me what i didnt expect though was having to guard her advertisement i did my best and held my own which was apparently enough for a postgame handshake from the lanky point guard and her proud papa id learn that the girl was kaela davis and that her father was former nba player antonio davis they had moved from chicago to atlanta and were looking to start an aau team my family and i drove back home freaking out i had always been a scrappy little something but i never imagined catching the eye of an nba player even though my team had been defeated no one in the gym could deny that the smallest person on the court was at least the second best player that day i actually didnt want to coach at all just because im not good at cutting kids davis told me when we caught up this week but it was right around the time i was retiring so everything kind of fell into place at the tryout i noticed everybody was so tall and i wasnt which was normal but these girls were all really tall coach antonio put us through one of the most intense workouts id ever been through my dad was there with me he had coached my former aau team before that team split up i made it through the workout holding my own against undoubtedly the best girls my age in the state of georgia davis called my parents a couple days later asking if i would like to be a member of the georgia ice his new girls basketball team i remember jumping on google maybe on my ipod touch and typing antonio davis whoa he played for the bulls and pacers he played against no way michael jordan welcome to the space jam must have been playing in my mind that movie was the reason i started playing basketball now im a degree of separation from jordan davis invited the team to his house to get to know each other i use the term house loosely a movie theater a game room a pool a basketball court the elevator was the thing that blew my mind i had never seen anything like it advertisement before i knew it i was over there pretty often it was the coolest thing ever to me and our team was talented in equal measure one of our first tournaments was at georgia tech we all arrived at the gym early to change into our bright orange and light blue uniforms georgia ice we were the first aau team that i remember to wear nike elite socks we had our names on the back of our jerseys our numbers on the sides of our shoes we qualified for the national championships pretty early in the aau season my family and i had never flown before davis bought the entire team firstclass tickets we were a bunch of 12yearold girls in first class having the time of our lives on an nba superstars dime we won the 12u national championship in 2008 i was really just looking for girls with raw talent to teach them to play the right way davis said i always wanted to practice more than i wanted to play but we just ended up getting really good things got really interesting the next year every girl playing basketball in the area at the time wanted to play for the georgia ice i was about 1000 times more nervous at this tryout and boy were there some superstars in the gym kaela davis anthonys daughter lexie brown dees daughter taryn griffey kens daughter diamond deshields delinos daughter the fact that so many famous fathers had come together to form this girldad super team was unheard of at the time this was pregirl dad era but they learned from an early age about teamwork and work ethic i think the vibe that we put out really just attracted more dads and daughters who really wanted to learn how to play the game the right way davis said the craziest thing for me was that ken griffey jrs dee browns and others of the world trusted me with their daughters and this process lexie and kaela grew up together when davis and dee brown played together for the toronto raptors lexie and taryn griffey later played on the same aau team in orlando while we were forming the georgia ice in atlanta their moms became friends and the girls played on the same team meaning lexie and taryn attended school in orlando during the week and then drove or flew to atlanta on the weekends to compete with the georgia ice advertisement diamond on the other hand was like me her aau team had disbanded and she was looking for an aau home we had played against each other several times growing up our teams had a bit of an u11 rivalry if there was such a thing at that age at that point i knew who i wanted to play with i said im going to play with them diamond said brown called the georgia ice a super team none of that was actually planned davis said when we had the opportunity to add someone like diamond deshields i didnt know if she was going to be a good fit i knew she was extremely athletic and had all the tools i just didnt know if she was going to mesh with our team but each and every girl that came our way just ended up being the perfect piece wed grow together as a team and as young women over the course of that season under the guidance of the goat dads having davis lead us reminded me a lot of when my dad coached me but i often wondered how it was to have a superstar dad and to have to perform in front of him it formed a bond among players for me just the fact that kaela lexie peyton whitted and taryn all had parents who were pros diamond said i got to interact with kids that kind of grew up the same way as i did in that aspect it was cool lexie said i think thats why me and diamond have been able to bond and stay close over the years because we have very similar upbringings and we can appreciate that about each other those sleepovers though were something in our second year together the aau national championships were conveniently held in orlando where taryn and lexie lived while our parents went back to their hotel rooms after games the whole team spent the weekend at the griffeys house i remember one couch so big all 15 of us slept on it comfortably advertisement sometimes wed be in hotel lobbies after games and the dads traded stories from griffeys greatest hits to davis time playing against jordan my family would sit in awe in time we all grew pretty close it just became like a family lexie said wed spend our time watching the youtube videos that were going viral at the time we liked to create our own content back then before it was trendy we were doing viral shit before viral was a thing said deshields in the summer of 2009 we traveled to virginia for the boo williams invitational as the starting point guard i suffered an acl injury that lexie says changed the course of her career giving her more time at the position i dont know if i can agree with that given her talent it was diamonds coming out party for us for sure said lexie every d1 womens basketball coach you could think of lined the sidelines to watch us work the greatest show on ice as we were called was as popular as it had ever been coming off of two aau national championships and garnering elitelevel college looks olympic gold medalist allisha gray eventually joined the team as well the good times would eventually end as they always have to wed all go on to focus on playing for our high school teams i went to collins hill high school and had the pleasure of getting my brains beat in over the next four years by diamond at norcross high and lexie at north gwinnett we began to compete against each other more than we played together priorities became different for some i for example was now quite certain that i was not going to play professionally and was just hoping to secure a scholarship i eventually signed to play division ii basketball at the university of montevallo in alabama lexie committed to maryland diamond to north carolina kaela and allisha to south carolina peyton whitted to penn state kristina nelson to notre dame and kylee smith to belmont advertisement from there life did its thing lexie transferred to duke to finish diamond to tennessee kaela and allisha won a national championship with dawn staley i transferred to the university of west georgia allison was drafted fourth in 2017 by the dallas wings kaela went to dallas as well a few picks later at no 10 diamond was drafted no 3 overall by the chicago sky in 2018 lexie would be a few picks behind at no 9 to the connecticut sun after playing in hungary for a season lexie was traded to the minnesota lynx where she played a significant role coming off of the bench for two seasons before injuries slowed her momentum heading into the bubble lexie was waived by chicago after training camp earlier this season before she was brought back and signed permanently she said her rekindled friendship with diamond helped her feel comfortable joining the sky yeah getting to chicago for me was like a hot ass mess she said you know me and diamonds relationship actually wasnt the greatest in college i was out of the league this year for three weeks so its really hard to get in its even harder to stay in having the relationships with the right people and you have to carry yourself professionally you can find a way back and diamond was a huge part of that if you told us we would be finishing a wnba season togetherwe wouldnt have even believed it pictwittercomhchwpsm6yr lexie brown lexiebrown september 19 2021 they played for different teams in the wubble last season and didnt talk when diamond suffered an injury lexies mom encouraged her to reach out my mom was just like i think she needs you back in her life brown said i was like nah shes fine but i invited her over for thanksgiving i was still with minnesota at the time but i was already feeling weird about that situation she was like yeah you should just come play with us in chicago james loves your game and i would love for you to be there advertisement lexie felt comfortable in minnesota at the time but had diamond put in a good word with chicago lexie and the lynx eventually parted ways at the end of 2020 chicago was the first team that called my agent she said they were trying to trade for me during free agency and they just couldnt i think that everything was a blessing in disguise even as kids winning titles together lexie and diamond didnt dream about playing for a professional championship being this close now to possibly getting to the wnba finals together which is a conversation neither one of us have ever had together lexie said chicago the no 6 seed is in the finals for the first time since 2014 the sky play game 3 friday in chicago with the series against phoenix tied 11 the possibility of winning a championship together as adults now becomes more real every day for both lexie and diamond even when diamond was a little younger she had doubts lexie says she had selfdoubt about her even getting to the wnba that was a shocking revelation to me i remember when we all walked into the gym at 13 years old and thinking wow these guys are going to the league and i am not we had played against each other for so long but i dont ever remember diamond being a noname so when she came in i already knew she was like that seeing them achieve all these years later makes our childhood memories all the sweeter looking back we were good teen players now we see it as the start of successful basketball careers for some i know when i walked in i was like oh this is a different level of tough diamond said like oh man im going to take what i can here deshields said i thought everybody was just equally tough i just saw everybody as an equal at that point i felt like we were all the best 13yearolds on the planet looking back i think we were photo courtesy of lexie brown get allaccess to exclusive stories

Aaliyah Edwards,Canadian star Aaliyah Edwards proud to be part of a growing community of women's basketball,https://www.cbc.ca/sports/aaliyah-edwards-opinion-shireen-ahmed-1.7187965,as the wnba begins training camps this week the excitement of new stars rising is in the air and on the court the medstar performance center in washington dc is the practice facility of the washington mystics and canadian basketball star aaliyah edwardss new team the celebrated forward who played her college ball at the university of connecticut under storied womens coach geno auriemma is being warmly welcomed her new city she threw the first pitch at a nationals mlb game and also helped lead cheers for the washington spirit the local nwsl team born in kingston ont edwards was recently drafted sixth overall by the mystics in the wnba draft and in just a few months the 21yearold will head to france with the womens national team for the paris olympics this is a big years for edwards from making it to the final four with uconn in one of the topviewed college basketball games in history to being a top draft pick for the wnba to representing canada on sports biggest stage edwards said that since her freshman year she has felt the growth of womens basketball which she refers to as community im just so grateful to be a part of it and impacting it she said with her wide trademark grin i feel like im not only acknowledging those that came before me and just trying to keep pushing that way pushing that momentum of bet on women but also you know paving the way for those coming behind me because im kind of opening up new doors and opportunities for the next generation watch edwards on inspiring the next generation edwards speaks with so much humility despite her accomplishments and being so recognizable because of her bright yellow braids and the face mask she wears when she plays edwards broke her nose in 2022 and has worn the mask ever since it hasnt affected her performance she averaged 176 points per game 9 rebounds made 74 per cent of her free throws finishing her ncaa with more than 1000 points shes tactical on defence and commits to the play and her team with such tremendous intensity and force those attributes and undeniable skills have put her on the map as she was named most improved player and was a semifinalist in voting for the naismith player of the year award her might on the court coupled with the face equipment reminds one of a young christine sinclair who similarly had to protect her face after breaking her nose and like sinclair edwards holds her country and her family close to her heart during an interview at the draft wnba reporter holly rowe asked edwards about what it means to her that canada was cheering her on edwards emotionally acknowledged the efforts of her family most particularly her mother who coached her during her exchange with rowe which admittedly also had me in tears edwards said she was hopeful that in following in her footsteps young players in canada would make their own impact i asked her about that moment first of all im not sure how many words i actually got out during my interview with holly because i was crying and choking up through half of it she said with a laugh i said a little prayer like you know god got me im just appreciative of all the blessings hes given me leading up to this point and when wnba commissioner cathy engelbert called my name thats when the tears went and the embrace with my family each one of my family members my teammates and also my college coaches there her uconn teammates including paige bueckers and nika muhl stood cheering and filmed her entire draft moment like proud parents the moment went viral edwards being so openly affected by the moment was touching it was a lot of emotions a lot of emotions for sure she said but i think it was just relief like ive always dreamed of this moment of playing professional basketball and playing in the w it was amazing edwards feels that to be a part of the basketball community in canada and be an advocate for it is important and necessary she is fully aware of her position as a role model and showing young canadian ballers how greatness lives here too the only downside edwards admits to while being away from canada is missing ketchupflavoured chips not available in the us and real maple syrup two staples of the canadian diet ive tried to put my uconn team onto that she said i definitely miss that the most since ive been here im trying to convert some people so well see how that goes national teammate kia nurse a fellow uconn alum said edwardss impact has been felt on the national team from a young age she debuted on the senior team at the tokyo olympics in 2021 nurse predicts that edwards will be a part of the canadian team for a while for us to have success on the world stage we have to have our best players nurse said and aaliyah is a big part of our group as far as the expectations for these olympics go edwards is ready to do whatever the team needs her to do she had just completed her freshman year of college when she made her olympic debut but this time she feels more prepared in her mental game my first olympics i was the youngest on the team and i was kind of new to that whole play and in that whole olympics environment she said i think now understanding the process of actually qualifying for olympics and going through all that with the senior womens national team i understand the stakes of what each game comes to she plans to take her competitiveness and raise it to an olympic level raising her game is something that edwards does exceptionally well but not everything has been seamless for edwards in march she was named as an adidas athlete and joined the ranks of pwhl player sarah nurse who promotes the global sports brand but being canadian and on a student visa it prevented edwards from utilizing the name image and likeness agreement in the us as an

Chelsea Gray,WNBA Champion Chelsea Gray Is Having Her Moment,https://www.essence.com/entertainment/sports/wnba-champion-chelsea-gray-las-vegas/,threetime wnba champion and fivetime allstar chelsea gray of the las vegas aces is having her moment and rightfully so not only is she fresh off of two backtoback wnba championships the adidas athlete recently joined the acc network accn as a college basketball analyst so of course she took the time to enjoy the fruits of her labor in her city las vegas that is during one of the biggest sporting events in the world the super bowl and she couldnt be prouder to represent when i first signed here the factor about coming here is its a big small town she tells essence at an adidas gifting suite at the conrad hotel in las vegas everybody is coming here now obviously it had entertainment and gambling but youre seeing the intersection of the workforce with tech and then you have music and then you have sport and all of that is kind of combined and so its been pretty cool to be a part of that and be a part of that growth gray also describes the joy of being a part of winning culture that makes her time in vegas magical we brought the first professional championship here in las vegas she beams and being a part of history you are able to write your name that you are a part of making history and i think thats pretty cool a talent like gray doesnt just happen overnight but with a lot of resilience hard work and love of the game i had a lot of brothers that really were into sports basketball football baseball she recalls of how her love of sport developed at a young age so i was just surrounded by sports all the time i just really gravitated to the competition of it being able to be outside in addition to her wnba accolades gray was an allamerican in college at duke guiding the blue devils to two acc tournament championships three acc regular season titles and three trips to the ncaa elite eight during her four years 201014 holding a hometown connection with fellow point guard damian lillard adidas even released grays own colorway of the adidas dame 8 last year the connection to adidas is what sparked her interest in her

Becky Hammon,Don’t forget the Las Vegas Aces set the standard as WNBA popularity explodes,https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/5488245/2024/05/13/las-vegas-aces-championship-standard-wnba/,wnba game 4 of last seasons wnba finals was a fitting culmination of the las vegas aces title run a closeout game that demanded contributions from the totality of the roster it was also a reminder of how fleeting greatness can be the aces down two starters with no expectation for their return in a potential doordie game 5 had just enough to eke out a onepossession win the jubilation of the result overshadowed how close las vegas was to experiencing a different outcome advertisement as the aces embark upon the 2024 season in pursuit of a threepeat its important to appreciate their excellence in this moment they have a target on their back from 11 other franchises but thats because las vegas is one of the best teams this league has ever seen although it seems like the aces have a long runway of titles in front of them with three allwnba players under age 30 their most recent coronation is a reminder of how precarious success can be at this time a year ago las vegas had a starting group of five potential future hall of famers that lineup didnt even last half the season and now candace parker is retired chelsea gray and kiah stokes couldnt suit up at the end of the finals with grays foot injury lingering to the start of the 2024 campaign most of the aces have signed belowmarket contracts to remain in las vegas and remain together but rosterbuilding might be out of their control with the upcoming expansion draft the core that exists today could have a chance to compete only in this particular season game frames allinlv pictwittercomlop3zgs7nb las vegas aces lvaces may 12 2024 thats why the aces arent shying away from the task in front of them they talk about creating habits and not looking too far ahead but theyve also made their ultimate goal very clear from the getgo to win and join the houston comets as the only franchises in league history with three consecutive championships when you come into a season with the aces uniform on the standard is going for a championship gray said las vegas has every reason to believe that goal is attainable it has the best player in the world aja wilson an unstoppable force on both ends of the floor who could become the fourth threetime mvp in league history wilsons impact is so undeniable that even team usa looked mortal at the 2024 olympic qualifying tournament without her in the middle go deeper aja wilson named nike signature athlete wilson relishes that the rest of the league is getting better using it to motivate her to keep working on her craft similarly her thirst for continuous improvement inspires teammates and rivals alike theres nothing like watching her simultaneously blow by and power through defenders while taking away their airspace on the other end shes a unique talent whose motor is neverending advertisement the aces also have one of the most dynamic point guards in league history one whose highlight reel defies logic and gravity and delights fans across sports gray brought her championship pedigree to las vegas and has continued to rack up hardware her motto this season is trying to chase history and be legendary theres jackie young and kelsey plum the bowling ball and the blur on the perimeter testing opposing defenses in diametric ways stokes controls the glass alysha clark defends everyone and sydney colson is a pest at the point of attack whatever style of play you seek as a basketball fan the aces provide some of it every skill is represented and put on display at the highest possible level under the direction of hall of fame coach becky hammon who has done nothing but win since stepping into this role las vegas is basketball paradise the aces play together and for each other and that commitment to the team concept shines through no matter what adverse situations they face this year is going to be harder than last year and last year was hella hard hammon said we come in with the pressure and well operate fine under that pressure but we know what the deal is only two teams in wnba history have even had a chance to threepeat in 27 seasons and not since the inaugural champion comets won four in a row has a team accomplished that feat no team in the nba has even gone backtobacktoback since 2002 in north american professional sports the threepeat has nearly gone extinct during this century which puts las vegas in rarefied air big a not the little one ajawilson22 allinlv pictwittercomsope6fc5qb las vegas aces lvaces may 11 2024 whether theyre the hero or the villain the aces story arc demands attention theyre chasing history at an individual and team level and forcing the rest of the league to match their standard superteams are popping up across the country in hopes of competing with what las vegas has built its tons of fun just to stay in the moment and understand what were building here wilson said the legacy that we are forming here is something thats so cool to be a part of advertisement so take a moment to appreciate what the aces have created when the season tips off tuesday enjoy the majesty of wilson the flair of gray the poise of young the feistiness of plum and how theyve brought out the best in themselves and their opponents as the wnba experiences an explosion of popularity remember they are the standardbearers the bar that has been set for the incoming rookies and everyone else photo of aja wilson and jackie

Chloe Jackson,Chlöe Pierre on redefining self-care and what it means for black women,https://www.breakingnews.ie/lifestyle/chloe-pierre-on-redefining-self-care-and-what-it-means-for-black-women-1419753.html,by abi jackson pa selfcare may be a term we use every day but what does it really mean its a question chle pierre founder of disruptive wellness platform brand thyself and author of new book take care the black womens guide to wellness started asking around five years ago overworking and under a lot of pressure challenges in her personal life and partying a lot didnt help and a series of pivotal moments like developing terrifying sleep paralysis made clear it was time to start taking better care of herself except pierre newly 30 at the time and working in pr and digital marketing realised she didnt know how it was a journey of learning and rediscovering what that is because i wasnt taught how to take care of myself in that sense she explains over zoom it was always such an outward externalfacing option make sure you do your hair and you look good having a wellbeing wakeup call is something many will relate to for pierre though what started as personal journey quickly became something much bigger when she started accessing the wellbeing spaces on offer and very soon realised that i was often the only black plussized person in the room not only was the wellness world very white it had also seemingly packaged selfcare into something very exclusive and expensive catering for an overwhelmingly slim cis middleclass clientele this was the catalyst for founding thyself thyselfspace in 2018 with the aim of diversifying the wellness industry and making selfcare more inclusive relatable and more welcoming to black women alongside running events workshops and content creation thyself works with brands looking to deliver on their own diversity goals theyve collaborated with the likes of nike asos and samsung and its evolved and grown over time pierre notes when i started off creating thyself i really wanted to push for change and change peoples perceptions but over the years you know weve been through covid weve been through lockdown ive become a mother ive experienced things it made me realise i cant change anyones thoughts she reflects i was on this journey to break down the wellness industry and i still want to do that but i know it starts with me so i portray the life i want to lead and curate the environments i want to be in and not only have i created a safe space for myself ive created a safe space for likeminded people who want to be there at the heart of this is a thriving community community is everything says pierre i really believe in the work we do as individuals but also building out into a wider community i wouldnt do any of this if it wasnt for community that is my biggest driver theres a bigger purpose in community no movement was ever created by one person i never really want the credit for things i just want to see change because that means other people will be happy safe and feel seen thats what joy is to me a lot of its about sharing ideas and options for selfcare without having to commodify everything as well as celebrating the cultural heritage and origins of many wellness practices and as pierre puts it giving credit where credit is due these are all themes she explores in the book alongside her own journey take care also sees pierre consult with various experts and dive into some key areas including imposter syndrome grief and loss authenticity motherhood and black beauty sharing stories and prompts along the way whilst it is essentially a guide pierre is not here to tell anyone how to do selfcare its more about empowering black women on their own journeys being aware of their own needs and offering options designed to welcome and celebrate them for pierre reaching this point herself when all this started five years ago meant spending time alone i do think discovering your own selfcare essentially comes through a lot of solitude so you discover what you like what works for you and what you need she says and those things arent even linked at times what you need and want are completely different things thats what ive learned about wellbeing that its actually sometimes quite uncomfortable just like most truths are quite uncomfortable to take on i always relate selfcare and wellness to becoming your own best friend but its not an overnight job plus things change to me its still an ongoing journey to be honest and this includes the last two years writing the book she says i feel like a completely different person to when i got the book offer my world and selfcare at that time was completely different and now being a mum i became a mum a year after accepting the offer its different im still learning so what does selfcare look like for pierre right now shes a massive fan of massage it really brings you back to yourself while mindful breathing and practising gratitude are also key i could moan til the cows come home but theres so much to be thankful for thats what draws me out of depression if im honest and one thing really lighting her up being in nature its free its beautiful it can fulfil you in ways you never expected you dont know what youre going to get you can take the same route every time but one left turn or right turn and youre completely on a different path and it brings you back to the simplicity of the human race and why were here outside of the buildings the work the relationships what our purpose is its just so grounding for me that is wonderful take care by chle pierre is published by headline available now message

in paris with boyfriend andrew pozzi in the stade de france to cheer her on never miss breaking news by signing up to our free email updates we have more newsletters never miss breaking news by signing up to our free email updates we have more newsletters katarina johnsonthompson laid it all on the line to secure heptathlon silver at the stade de france for her first olympic medal the liverpudlian sat 121 points behind belgian champion nafissatou thiam entering the final event the 800 metres she faced a nearly impossible task needing to beat thiam by more than eight seconds to surpass her main rival johnsonthompson clocked a personal best 20490 but it was not quite enough as she finished 36 points behind thiam who has now twice successfully defended her olympic title belgiums noor vidts completed the podium johnsonthompson finished nearly six seconds ahead of the olympic champion and secondfastest overall behind the united states anna hall nine of the top 11 finishers clocked personal bests while hall equalled her seasons best 20439 a maiden medal has been a long time coming for johnsonthompson who finished 13th on olympic debut at london 2012 then sixth at the rio 2016 games the 31yearold was then forced to pull out of the tokyo 2020 olympics after sustaining a calf injury in the 200 metres heres a glimpse into her life away from the olympics as reported by wales online johnsonthompson has been in a relationship with fellow olympian and british hurdler andrew pozzi since 2018 the couple maintain a longdistance relationship with pozzi based in cardiff while johnsonthompson has resided in loughborough and montpellier since they began their romance threetime olympian pozzi was supporting johnsonthompson from the sidelines in paris after having to hang up his spikes just days before this years games due to a serious ankle fracture sustained during training in an emotional social media announcement he shared after missing the 2023 season with serious injury i have battled exceptionally hard to return to the world stage and earnt my place at what would have been my fourth olympic games unfortunately as i continued to build and improve upon my 1323s clocking in montgeron my body gave way in training to another serious ankle fracture pozzi went on to say i have decided that now is the right time for me to retire from professional athletics expressing both profound sadness and acceptance of his decision knowing he had given his all to the sport with this is a profoundly sad moment but also one that i can embrace fully with the knowledge that i have approached every minute of my time in this sport with uncompromising focus resolute determination and the highest of standards despite his retirement pozzi has been a vocal supporter of johnsonthompsons achievements celebrating her world heptathlon gold last year on social media by stating the best all round athlete on the planet again as the paris games approached there was chatter about whether it might be katarina johnsonthompsons final appearance especially if she secured a spot on the podium in what could be the pinnacle of her career however johnsonthompson has dismissed any notion of retirement from heptathlon in an interview with athletics weekly she expressed her commitment to the sport the phrase one last push doesnt come to mind i feel like i am growing into myself and the longer that ive been doing the sport the more i know about myself and i know how to be ready for it she continued i understand what my body needs what my mind needs and how to get a good performance i feel like i am getting stronger in the sense of i know how to do it better than i did 10 years ago it saddens me at the thought of having all this knowledge and then stopping as long as i am competitive i will continue the sport speaking on gb news on the money johnsonthompson revealed her plans to retire at 35 which could see her competing in the subsequent olympics in los angeles in 2028 discussing the financial challenges faced by athletes she explained i think the illusion of track and field is many people unless they are ranked in the top 10 in the world struggle to earn a decent wage adding for me the struggle was that my career isnt going to last a lifetime im going to probably retire when im 35 and many banks dont really understand that sort of payment setup but with the rise in living costs many people are struggling to get on the property ladder for different reasons johnsonthompson reportedly boasts an estimated net worth of around 45million back in 2022 she was named as the fourth richest british sportswoman under 30 years old according to the heat rich list much of her net worth has been boosted by her partnership with nike while she has also endorsed other huge brands including estee lauder ea mller and british gas despite her sizeable net worth johnsonthompson admitted she had struggled to buy her first home appearing on gb news on the money she said i had trouble buying my first home a couple of years ago i think the illusion of track and field is it was so nice to say all those facts and stuff but many people unless they are ranked in the top 10 in the world struggle to earn a decent wage for me the struggle was that my career isnt going to last a lifetime and im going to probably retire when im 35 and many banks dont really understand that sort of payment setup but with the rise in living costs many people are struggling to get on the property ladder for different reasons katarina johnsonthompson has shared the poignant motivation behind her winning drive in the aftermath of personal tragedy the loss of her father ricardo in 2017 when he was just 59 ricardo a production assistant at znstv died in his native bahamas having lived apart from katarina since she was one year old despite the geographical distance after katarinas return to liverpool with her family after a year their bond remained strong in an emotional revelation to the daily mail months after his passing the heptathlete confessed the difficult period had a galvanising effect on her performance what happened with my dad is why i have been so switched on in competitions she said fuelled by her father never seeing her win driving her to succeed before her mother who is always ringside supporting her reflecting further in a candid interview with the guardian she said i am proud of myself because there have been some hard and difficult times but dad definitely spurred me on this year i wanted to start winning things i wanted my family to see me doing well and i think i have done that for sure,2024-08-09T19:59:51Z,21.0,"['katarina', 'johnsonthompson', 'finally', 'ended',

Lisa Leslie,"Despite Caitlin Clark Move, Nike’s Gender Bias Over Signature Sneaker Exposed by Ex-Agent (Exclusive)",https://www.essentiallysports.com/wnba-basketball-news-despite-caitlin-clark-move-nikes-gender-bias-over-signature-sneaker-exposed-by-ex-agent-exclusive-lisa-leslie-leonard-armato/,more sports es fancast may 24 2024 1002 am cdt via imago caitlin clark leonard armato credits imago via imago caitlin clark leonard armato credits imago the basketball world turned their heads when it was reported the indiana fever rookie caitlin clark would be signing a 28 million deal for 8 years the agreement also landed clark a signature shoe which is expected to be out on the market soon however womens sports are taking a step towards advancement and with it equal recognition but things werent as breezy for them as they look now now that the womens sports after the emergence of clark hit a record ticket revenue of around 2 million during the recent indiana fever game against the new york liberty it is time to look at some of the biases that the sport has endured over these years entrepreneur and sports agent leonard armato recently got in an exclusive chat with essentiallysports and answered some looming questions from vishal kolar armatos experience as an agent got us some stories that were previously privy to a few people his account of trying to get a signature deal with nike on behalf of the wnba veteran lisa leslie rang a few bells of undervaluing womens sports previously advertisement article continues below this ad vishal kolar another thing youve been very vocal about right is is the gender pay gap pay gap in sports um and your volleyball league did a lot of progress in wiping that out um and now caitlin clarks nike deal started a completely different conversation with the likes of aja wilson you know essentially being ignored um as someone whos seen these decisions up close like what do you think drives these scenarios and more importantly like how how do they respond to these claims of bias leonard armato well its really interesting um i remember representing lisa lesley and we went to nike way back when and said hey we want a shoe deal we want a signature shoe and they laughed at me and said theres no way you know nobody buys shoes because women wear them you know when women play basketball they look at michael jordan and see what hes wearing and thats what they want to wear so you know well pay you little money but thats it they dont you know youyou dont drive any sales for us advertisement article continues below this ad leslie got her nike total air 9 in 1998 which was a major success during that time and also was the first major shoe by a womens basketball player meanwhile the craze for jordans is such that nike introduced a special batch of air jordans 4s for wnba players in 2023 the shoes were minty green in color and were introduced to the fans by nikes senior designer kelsey amy therefore there is no denying that the sporting company has pushed mens sneakers and gained a lot from it meanwhile with clarks emergence the disparity has equaled to a lot extent as per the guardian clark received numerous offers of shoe deals including one from under armour and another from adidas for 16 million and 6 million respectively for four years but the ncaa queen chose nike over others advertisement article continues below this ad she will soon release her shoes and if fans are to be believed clarks signature shoes could break records that were made by jordans in 1985 finally it looks like mens basketball has got a worthy opponent in a woman player this story from armato only demonstrates how far

Candace Parker,Mamas At Work: Candace Parker Takes Us Inside Hartt's Safari-Themed Nursery,https://www.essence.com/lifestyle/mamas-at-work-candace-parker/,on june 10 candace parker surprised fans by announcing that she and her wife anya petrakova welcomed their second child together a month prior on may 21 named hartt summitt petrakov parker the littlest member of their brood makes them a family of five now its been beautiful chaos having a teenager in 15yearold lailaa a 2yearold in airr and now an infant all under one roof but parker who recently retired from the wnba is loving every minute with her favorite teammates her family shes also had the chance to partner up with another special team in crate kids the kids furniture sector of crate barrel partnered with parker ahead of hartts arrival to create the ultimate safarithemed nursery the end result is a warm inviting space coated in rich browns and soft greens and featuring some truly cozy furniture including a luxurious glider that makes hartts room the place to be at casa petrakov parker we talked to the new president of adidas womens basketball threetime wnba champion and seventime allstar about reimagining her home for her newest addition being a mom of three children at wildly different stages of their young lives and why her favorite form of selfcare still revolves around her littles essence for baby hartts nursery what was the inspiration i see a lot of lion imagery and browns candace parker we envisioned a bright safarithemed colorful room with lots of style and cute details the most difficult part of designing and decorating a new space is taking the ideas in your head and making them a reality but the crate kids design desk team made this such an easy process we would have never thought to make the walls a warm terracotta color but the crate kids team included it in the design renderings and we are so happy with the final look it pairs so nicely with the safarithemed pieces like the jungleinspired crib quilt you briefly began to discuss this but how did crate kids come in and bring your ideas for the space to life the crate kids team was incredible to work with we loved collaborating with the designers to bring our vision to life there were a lot of components that went into this nursery and we loved building out our vision from scratch with the crate kids registry anya was in awe when she saw the finished room and kept saying that it looks so stylish and cozy the full nursery is available to shop on crate kids now what is your favorite thing in the room that bed looks mighty cozy i also love the green furniture i also love the green furnitureits such an extraordinary and elegant color the sage dresser and crib are two of my favorite pieces in the room a good rocking chair was also a musthave for the nursery and i am in love with the glider it pairs so nicely with the sage green furniture terracotta walls and wood accents throughout the room how are you adjusting to being a mother of three with a teenager and two kiddos under two just like in basketball were adjusting our defense from man to man to zone its been especially exciting having two new courts to play on between the nursery and new room but we are loving it and are so excited to continue to play our starting lineup you are on serious diaper duty when you have the chance how do you practice selfcare its definitely been difficult finding time but i honestly think that the best selfcare is spending time with family whether its watching lais volleyball games or chasing goose around the house its my favorite way to spend my downtime you can shop items from parkers full nursery for hartt over at crate kids essencecom is part of essence communications inc essence may receive

Candace Parker,Candace Parker Shares Her Vision For Her Next Chapter - Essence,https://www.essence.com/fashion/candace-parker-adidas-wnba-all-star-weekend-feature/,candace parker the newly appointed president of adidas womens basketball candidly opened up about her hopes for her latest era since announcing her retirement from basketball a sport shes been enthralled by for decades she has shifted her focus to elevating a brand that feels intrinsically part of her in phoenix where she attended allstar weekend for the first time as a nonplayer her discernment rang loudly over a call she took while prepping for press appearances and events she details that its important to understand what she and adidas aim to accomplish were trying to sell shoes and have adidas on as many peoples feet as we can she says but in the process were trying to grow the game of basketball and grow womens basketball especially parker notes that right now is an ideal time for this given the eyes that are fixated on the wnba and womens sports the threetime wnba champion former las vegas aces player and seventime allstar says she thinks that adidas can succeed by making an impact from a grassroots standpoint she declares doing so will mean providing more opportunities for athletes who have deserved it for a long time currently players on the roster include kahleah copper chelsea gray erica wheeler and others copper is a standout due to her knack for style on and off the court notably part of the work will be parker and the brand teaming up to raise the bar and continue to put women at the forefront says the naperville illinois native parker isnt taking her new appointment lightly she expresses that shes been in three stripes since her sophomore year in high school and through college at the university of tennesseeshe counts that as 16 years professionally my longeststanding partnerships are gatorade and adidas she said she also mentions she will never forget what it was like putting on her first pair of tracy mcgrady pro model sneakers years ago parkers first official adidas sneaker under the ace line was launched in 2010 first includes the ace commander and the ace versatility which is a significant part of the canon associated with women basketball players it began with sheryl swoopes who was the first woman to have her own athletic sneaker according to andscape in 2021 adidas released three colorways of the exhibit a sneaker each inspired by parker since the role will take on a leadership capacity parker explains that she will identify hoopers who have passion and want to do more than lace up their sneakers and cash a check ive always tried to represent the brand in a positive way and so now its just a different role in doing that im so grateful she said since she will always be a player first this is the unique prowess she brings to adidas parker hopes she will bring this mentality or the players perspective to the boardroom i feel like the culture that we want to build at adidas centers empowerment she said when you feel ownership for something and you feel empowered by something that youre a part of youre going to work harder for it she adds that its not by chance that anyone is given equity and power one should go above and beyond when given these opportunities says parker we want to be that brand that is for the athletes represents the athletes and empowers the athletes candace shares she expresses that she feels she is building this type of internal culture while being in search of athletes who will align with these ideals she says shes a testament to what can happen when an athletic companys culture is largely focused on athletes i have been in different positions with adidas and through it all theyve stuck with me ive been overseas for six months out of the year ive been pregnant ive been injured with conviction she expands on this notion of togetherness parker says that she and adidas both had a passion for growing together thats what a partnership is and thats what i want to do in this roster continue to make sure were inspiring the next generation parker says athletes are dismantling the shut up and dribble remark from years ago candace says this notion carries over to more than just politics too in her words i think its also your career ends and the lights dim as soon as youre done playing youre not relevant she said yet she says athletes are changing that narrative she firmly states that as a graduate and degree holder from the university of tennessee she feels that her experiences overseas and in the us playing basketball have molded her into a stakeholder and she believes that there are a number of athletes who can be valuable to organizations and corporations in addition to decisionmaking entities her 15yearold daughter lailaa is a perfect example of what is on the horizon for the future generation she believes she can do anything she puts her mind to she said i think thats what were ushering in is the next generation that really truly believes that and so we need people that are in positions and making decisions that will put them in the positions to be able to

of the country she has dressed up for fenerbahe for two years from 2017 to 2019 apparently her pairing with the turkeybased club brings another 100000 season to her bank account in her last year with the franchise she also won the turkish cup proving her grip on the game internationally furthermore she earned the title of turkish super league champion twice marking her efforts in 2018 and 2019

joining hands with one of the rival brands of the sports apparel mogul under armour in 2022 kelsey plum said those transitions entering the professional league from college can be a lot easier if you have flashcards on what to do and what not to do i think youre going to see a lot of cool things coming out in the future with me the next generation and of course under armour leading the way in that

Kristi Toliver,"'It will happen': Mavs assistant, Sparks guard Kristi Toliver sees female NBA head coach in near future. Maybe her",https://theathletic.com/2900680/2021/10/20/it-will-happen-mavs-assistant-sparks-guard-kristi-toliver-sees-female-nba-head-coach-in-near-future-maybe-her/,kristi toliver remembers going to a dallas mavericks game to see her favorite player jason kidd she was around 9 years old a few years later in high school in virginia she wore no 5 because of him fast forward a few more years and the 34yearold wnba star can now be found throwing balls to giving advice to and working out with athletes like luka doncic as an assistant on kidds dallas mavericks coaching staff advertisement its truly been a full circle for the twotime wnba champion and threetime allstar i was a fan of his as a kid growing up i wore no 5 in honor of jason he was my favorite toliver recalls with a grin he used to wear the armband and so i had the armband 5 too as a point guard his ability to see the game and read the game was just great this is an awesome opportunity to be with this team for me it was a nobrainer to be working with jason kidd especially with his leadership and i know hes a great teacher hired as a mavs assistant coach in august toliver will sit on the sidelines next to the famous point guard who helped the mavs win their only championship and serve as a second pair of eyes for a mavs team looking to make some noise this season starting with thursdays season opener at the hawks her influence will be seen hopefully all over the place she says toliver became the 15th female assistant coach in nba history as a point guard for the la sparks shes the first active wnba player to work as an nba assistant its not a new role for her after serving as a wizards assistant from 2018 to 2020 when she played for the mystics im right behind jason interacting with the guys to me im just another set of eyes she says what im seeing on the court i can relay that to the coaches and players because as a point guard you want as many sets of eyes on the action as you can have kidd agrees when you look at what kristi brings being a player still playing its incredible kidd says she has a different view as a player today also shes coached with the wizards so shes had experience she came highly recommended throughout the league when you talk about players in washington who spoke very highly of her once we committed to her i got to watch her play a little bit before she got hurt just talking to her i felt she would bring a lot of value to our staff advertisement her agreement with the mavs ensures it wont interfere with her wnba career according to reports playing in la and coaching in dallas is different than her previous wnbanba duties as a player and coach for different organizations in the same city but toliver was eager to coach again it kind of just happened she says of what brought her to dallas i definitely wanted to get back into the league i didnt want to be out for too long i missed it and just had the itch over the summer she fielded calls from several teams seeking an assistant i had a lot of great conversations on the nba level g league level and so yeah i answered every phone call and this one just stuck toliver says of the mavs call with former mavs player and current assistant general manager michael finley kidd and new mavs gm nico harrison from the jump it was very comfortable i had watched them finley and kidd as players and i know nico through nike so that connection from the jump was immediate she says toliver a 12year wnba veteran knows how to win in addition to her two wnba championships with la 2016 and washington 2019 as a freshman in 2006 she led maryland to its first womens basketball national championship shes a threetime wnba allstar 2013 2018 2019 and was the 2012 wnba most improved player toliver has also played professionally in europe during the wnba offseason and has been part of six russian league championships her knowledge of the game and decades of experience make her the right person to help guide this young mavs team sparks head coach derek fisher endorsed her nba role i think in order to be a good coach you need an understanding of the game to some degree he says i think shes a student of basketball that she really loves it so i think those things really help advertisement i think her experience as a player really helps because shes been in a lot of the situations that youre talking to someone about pickandroll defensive situations or getting to your spots offensively and getting your shot off late in the game fisher adds shes been there before so she has all the ingredients and shes intentional about it she really wants to do it i think shes going to do very well her experience in washington i think for players in dallas theyll be able to see its not just something she decided all of a sudden that she wanted to do shes been pretty clear about this for the last few years and im really happy for her that shes going to have that opportunity tolivers presence specifically as an active player brings a unique perspective and dynamic to the mavs one they hope works in their favor she brings that championship mentality i think shes been great for us doncic says she helps a lot with all the players talking to them and so far shes been great her success is something players aspire to they say shes a champion shes been places where we want to go as a team to the finals and with a ring on her finger says mavs guard jalen brunson one of tolivers crew in addition to doncic dwight powell and dorian finneysmith with whom she works directly so hearing her insight and hearing what she has to say shes very quiet but when she speaks its very knowledgeable and im always all ears when she speaks these past couple of weeks getting to know her and how she operates has been very helpful to me its always special when you get current or former players to speak and share their knowledge you get people who have been in the fire to tell you about their experiences or what they think so having insight like that is very special toliver calls coaching as a current player a luxury for me because it provides her with a new perspective on communicating and teaching its good and it helps me with my ability to communicate both here and then going back to los angeles she says its just rep on top of rep on top of rep i already know how they are feeling and what they are seeing because i was just doing it inside training camp episode 3 coaches we introduce you to jareddudley619 and kristitoliver and hear how their recent careers as players have helped them shape the kind of coaches they want to be thats a wrap on training camp biosteelsports mffl pictwittercomu61yhbd0yg dallas mavericks dallasmavs october 16 2021 the game is the same but my leadership style is different from say assistant coach darrell armstrongs and even jasons and thats the beauty of it all toliver says thats why having such diversity in this sport is so important because everyone can touch someone differently and i think i do that with just me being me not even just because im female advertisement the nba which celebrates its 75th anniversary this season appeared to be moving in the direction of hiring its first female head coach this summer when san antonio spurs assistant coach becky hammon became a finalist for the portland trailblazers job they eventually hired former nba player chauncey billups currently there are a handful of female assistant coaches in the nba in addition to hammon the longestserving female assistant coach in nba history who joined the spurs in 2014 others include jenny boucek with the indiana pacers teresa witherspoon with the new orleans pelicans and edniesha curry with the trailblazers according to the undefeated 12 of the 15 female coaches joined the league after 2017 with a record 11 coaching simultaneously in 201920 what does toliver think about the future of women in the nba there will be a female head coach i know the opportunities are there she says i dont know sooner rather than later but at some point it will happen there are a lot of qualified women out there its just a matter of getting that opportunity when the door comes knocking i think someone will be able to answer that call could that someone be her absolutely she says im leaving the door open but right now im just finding my path
