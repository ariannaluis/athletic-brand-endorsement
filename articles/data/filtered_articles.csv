LeBron James,"Kevin Durant joins Ryan Reynolds, LeBron James, Tom Brady and J.J. Watt by buying stake in $4.4 billion football club with massive international following",https://talksport.com/football/2006335/kevin-durant-paris-saint-germain-ryan-reynolds-purchase-worth/,"Kevin Durant is joining the big money club. LeBron James, Ryan Reynolds, Tom Brady and J.J. Watt already hold special keys to the front gate. By becoming a minority shareholder of Paris Saint-Germain, an NBA superstar who just made history with his fourth Olympic gold medal in Paris has again raised the profile of the biggest sport in the world.  ""BREAKING: 2x NBA Champion Kevin Durant has invested in Paris Saint-Germain through his Boardroom Sports Holdings, LLC via Arctos Partners, the strategic minority investor in the club,"" Boardroom tweeted on Monday evening. Durant invested ""a few millions dollars of his own money"" to buy a stake in PSG, according to ESPN.  Reynolds and Rob McElhenney own Wrexham, James has a stake in Liverpool, Brady bought into Birmingham City and Watt is a Burnley investor.  Durant, a 14-time NBA All-Star, is set to make $51 million with Phoenix Suns this season and is on a four-year, $191 million contract that expires in 2026. The 35-year-old forward only trails James in scoring among active NBA players and is Team USA's all-time leading scorer in the Olympics. Durant's career earnings on the court surpass $395 million. The No. 2 overall pick of the 2007 NBA Draft started his career with the Seattle SuperSonics, made his name in Oklahoma City, and won two NBA championships with the Golden State Warriors' dynasty before bouncing to Brooklyn and Phoenix. To win his record fourth gold medal, Durant rejoined former Warriors teammate Steph Curry with Team USA in the 2024 Paris Olympics. “It’s great,” Durant told reporters, including talkSPORT, last month in London. “It’s exciting times. He’s at the point in his career where this is probably the last thing he wants to check off on a résumé."" Curry followed that up by leading Team USA to a tough win over Victor Wembanyama and France to capture gold. PSG is valued at $4.4 billion, according to Forbes, and recently was the home of Kylian Mbappe.  Lionel Messi and Neymar also were associated with the three-time defending Ligue 1 champions, who sold a minority stake to investment firm Arctos in December 2023. Qatar Sports Investments are the controlling shareholders of PSG. Durant's strong US name recognition should allow PSG to further expand into the United States market, with the 2026 World Cup being primarily played in the US. Durant collects over $45 million annually in off-the-court endorsements and has collaborated with Nike, Fanatics and FanDuel. Boardroom is a sports, media and entertainment brand co-founded by Durant, who's also purchased stakes in MLS' Philadelphia Union, NWSL's Gotham FC and a Major League Pickleball franchise. After wining the NBA Rookie of the Year with Seattle in 2007-08, Durant has averaged 27.3 points, 7 rebounds and 4.4 assists while winning two NBA Finals MVPs in his 16-year career.

LeBron James,“They Ignored Marketing”: Stephen A Smith Blasts Team USA Over Caitlin Clark Snub but Applauds LeBron James’ Genius Move in Paris,https://www.essentiallysports.com/wnba-basketball-news-they-ignored-marketing-stephen-a-smith-blasts-team-usa-over-caitlin-clark-snub-but-applauds-lebron-james-genius-move-in-paris/,"More Sports ES Fancast Aug 13, 2024 | 2:07 AM EDT USA Today via Reuters May 18, 2024; Brooklyn, New York, USA; Indiana Fever guard Caitlin Clark (22)

Center. Mandatory Credit: Wendell Cruz-USA TODAY Sports Did Team USA drop the ball by ignoring Caitlin Clark's marketing potential? Less than 24 hours after Team USA’s men’s basketball team handed France a defeat in the finals, the women’s team did the same. They defeated the host nation by a narrow 67-66 margin on Sunday to claim their eighth consecutive gold at the Olympics. Despite these efforts and achievements, Stephen A. Smith believes, “Team USA missed an opportunity,” and he’s not apologetic for saying this. On August 13th, Smith unveiled his perspective via his official YouTube channel. “When you talk about marketing the sport, I think Team USA missed an opportunity to elevate the profile of women’s excellence in the sport of basketball because they ignored marketing,” he said after applauding Team USA’s women for returning with their eighth consecutive gold around their necks. For Smith, Caitlin Clark was an opportunity Team USA could have seized. Her addition to Team USA would have been a marketing boost. “Box office matters… we want to act like it doesn’t matter, but it does,” he added. For context, 4 of Team USA’s games over the past week drew an audience of less than 13,000. Meanwhile, the Indiana Fever alone recorded about 16,898 viewers per game for 11 straight since Clark’s arrival. ADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad He even pointed out how the men’s basketball team is taking advantage of marketing opportunities. “It’s not an accident I saw Anthony Edwards with those Adidas shoes, or LeBron James with his gold-plated shoes, but I saw that. Adidas took advantage of the marketing opportunity. LeBron took advantage of the marketing opportunity. It matters,” he added. Quite evidently, Smith seems to be right. But how has Caitlin Clark’s omission from Team USA affected her? Did Team USA just make the biggest mistake by snubbing Caitlin Clark? React! Reactions ADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad Well, it did affect her, but in a good way. In fact, it turned out to be a blessing in disguise. “I honestly can’t wait to not touch a basketball for a while,” she told The Athletic after the WNBA All-Star matchup. Most of the rookies who share similar hype haven’t had the privilege of a break. But Clark made the most of the WNBA’s 24-day Olympic break, vacationing in Mexico with her teammates and attending India State Fair. “I think relaxing and reflecting on everything that’s happened to me over the course of the last year is going to be super important because my life has moved so fast,” she added. Above all, she finally got time to relax after March 2023. Now that it’s time to return, she might have reanalyzed her WNBA rookie season, which is extremely important in the Rookie of the Year race. Her first game after the Olympics break will be against Pheonix Mercury on 17th August. What do you think? Will she be stronger and better this time?

Ronaldinho,10 Greatest No.10s in Brazil History Ranked,https://www.givemesport.com/the-10-greatest-no10s-in-brazil-history-ranked/,"Your changes have been saved  Email is sent Email has already been sent Please verify your email address. You’ve reached your account maximum for followed topics.                     In the realm of football, the No.10 shirt carries a weighty significance, not just for any team, but for the entire sport. It's a symbol of recognition, a testament to a player's skill, craft, and ability that deserves a number that stands out. Traditionally given to attacking midfielders but with the positional fluidity of modern-day football, 'No.10s' can feature across the frontline and deeper and so does the shirt number.
                         There are few clubs or nations where a shirt number holds such a profound significance as Brazil. This is a nation that has given birth to football legends like Pele, Ronaldinho, and Neymar — all of whom have proudly worn the yellow shirt with the iconic green '10' emblazoned on the back, with the latter being the most recent. With Real Madrid's Rodrygo the latest in a long line of legends to don the famous jersey at the 2024 Copa America, GIVEMESPORT has ranked the greatest Brazilians to wear the jersey over the years.
     From Ronaldo Nazario to Rivaldo, Brazil's conveyor belt of attacking talent is simply unrivalled in the world of football.                     The Premier League and its relationship with Brazilian players are bipolar, to say the least, especially in the league's formative years. However, for Juninho Paulista, the transition to English football from Brazil was as seamless as the football he plays.
                         The diminutive mercurial maestro was coined the moniker 'The Little Fella' during his spells at Middlesbrough, where his person and effortless ease posed a fascinating figure, especially at 5ft5 tall. For Brazil, that talismanic shine never withered, donning the 10 jerseys with the same authority and picking up two honours with the national team, the 2002 World Cup and the 1997 Confederations Cup.

                         An influential figure in one of Brazil's World Cup wins, Rai started the 1994 World Cup as the captain before being relieved of his duties during the tournament and benched in the latter stages, as Brazil would win the competiton on the global stage for the first time in 24 years. Yet, Rai's reputation always shone brightly among the Brazilian public. He was an adventurous player on and off the pitch who established himself as one of the most revered players in Paris Saint-Germain's history. The former Sao Paulo was a final third fiend who would latch onto any half-chance in and out of the box and use his stocky build to his advantage.

                          When Brazil clinched the 1970 World Cup, it wasn't Rivelino who wore the shirt but a certain Pelé. Rivelino, Brazil's number 11, would later have the opportunity to shine in the '74 and '78 editions wearing the No.10. Briefly seen as Pelé's sidekick, was also idolised by Diego Maradona. The Argentine legend hailed the tricky, left-footed midfielder as 'one of the best ever.' Rivelino's ability to weave through a sea of challenges and entice opponents onto him before slipping the ball into vacated space was clear to see in Maradona's game.
                         The 92-capped international is also regarded as the perfector of the 'elastico' skill, which bamboozles defences with quick feet. He learned this skill from Sergio Echigo, one of his Corinthians teammates.

                     The legend of Jair lives on even nearly 20 years after his passing. A man credited as the pioneer of Brazil's continental success before a meteoric rise on the world stage, Brazil won the 1949 Copa America before finishing runner-up in the World Cup the year after. Jair still holds the record for the most amount of goals scored at a Copa America, nine in 1949. A wide forward who drove with such intent that it created fear, Jair's failure to get Brazil over the line against Uruguay in the 1950 World Cup was his biggest regret.

     Brazilian wonderkids crop up every year, but these are the 10 best in Football Manager 2024.                     One of the three Ballon d'Or winners to feature on the list, Kaka is one of the greatest modern players to play for Brazil, let alone wear the ‘10’ shirt. The former AC Milan and Real Madrid star was one of the best players in the world in the mid to late 2000s, with multiple crowing moments in the Champions League as well as dazzling in two separate Confederations Cup-winning teams for Brazil. An attacking midfielder who could play in any era and not look out of place: A gliding swan-like style, with the nous to anticipate offensive moves before they've developed.

     Brazil have been blessed with some remarkable defenders including Cafu and Roberto Carlos.                     Neymar’s career with Brazil shouldn't be understated. He hasn't won a World Cup or secured a Copa America despite coming close in 2021, but since the age of 18, when he first put on a Selecao shirt, he has performed to an individual level not many have ever reached for the nation.
                         Mainly a left-sided player at the club level, a role on the inside as a more traditional #10 is where Neymar has operated in Brazil sides, emphasising his central role in any Brazlian coach plans, especially Dunga’s. Loathe or love him, being the country’s highest-ever goal scorer and winning Brazil’s first Olympic gold medal in Rio in 2016 warrants his inclusion on this list as the still-modern poster boy that the new generation aspires to replicate.

     Neymar has been financially rewarded in a big way, and his current net worth reflects that.                       Whilst Neymar has been seen as the epitome of the Brazilian superstar in recent generations, Ronaldinho was the original representation. A man fond of the odd party, as a player, he turned most pitches he played on into his dancefloor. After a trademark mesmerising run where he would slalom and, at times, humiliate his opposition markers and the goalkeeper before wheeling away and performing his 'Leprechaun' celebration. Despite the litany of trophies and memorable moments, Ronaldinho was a footballer that was designed to entertain - and that he did, at the highest level.

                         Out of the 15 clubs that Rivaldo has played for, he only made more appearances for one (Barcelona), than he did for Brazil. In fact, the memories of Rivaldo’s glittering seem exclusive to his peaking years for the Spanish side and his country.
                         Though a more impactful player for Barcelona than Brazil, Rivaldo’s involvement in Brazil’s 2002 World Cup triumph, wearing the No. 10 shirt, ahead of the likes of Ronaldinho and Juninho - formed a potent front two with Ronaldo Nazario that will be etched into Brazilian history.

As Pele's national team successor, Zico was thrust under the national spotlight once he took over and embraced it to the fullest degree. With the ball seemingly stuck to his feet and on a right foot that could unlock the tightest of defences, the Flamengo icon was a talismanic figure across all the teams he played for.

     From Diego Maradona to Pele, a select number of stadiums have been renamed in honour of some legendary footballers.                      Any list mentioning Brazilian footballers is often headlined by Pele. Not just regarded as one of the greatest players to play the game, if not the greatest, Pele was one of the most accomplished sports athletes ever. A haul of more than 1,000 goals only tells one half of Pele's remarkable career both domestically and internationally.
                         Ask those who have watched the great man play; it is a blessing as much as an experience, even during his brief time in the United States for New York Cosmos at the twighlight of his career. Ronaldo stated that his ""legacy transcends generations,"" a fitting description of a man who has won more World Cups than any other player in men's footballing history.

his medal. REUTERS/Evelyn Hockstein Did Stephen Curry really make McDonald's France change their menu? What’s your take on this wild rumor? For over 15 years now, Stephen Curry has been an influential figure in American basketball. By winning four championship titles, setting himself as the All-Time Three-Pointer leader, and winning several accolades, he has become a household name domestically. The 2024 Paris Olympics gave him the opportunity to prove his worth on the international stage as well, as he led Team USA to his fifth consecutive Gold Medal. However, was his influence in the Olympics strong enough to consider bringing about a change in the menu of France’s McDonald’s? As it turns out, the answer is Yes. Although, it was not something that the player personally set out to do. In the aftermath of the Finals of the men’s basketball tournament between Team USA and France, the official Instagram handle of ‘McDonald’s France’ uploaded a post, carrying a picture of their Classic Curry sauce. As a joke, a caption was placed right on top of the sauce that read “pour des raisons evidentes, on songe a retirer cette sauce,” which literally translates to “for obvious reasons, we are considering removing this sauce.” Another caption was put on the side that stated, “Pour 4 ans minimum” (For at least 4 years). It wouldn’t have taken a genius to put two and two together to understand the context behind this post. Stephen Curry initially struggled to make a mark during the Paris Olympics. He blamed it on the FIBA rules and standards that were quite different from the ones established by the NBA. However, he boldly put his ultimate prowess on display during the Semi-Finals against Serbia, which Team USA was on the brink of losing. The 36-year-old repeated his actions during the final as well by securing a score of 24 points, 1 rebound, and 5 assists against France, as he went 8-13 with his field goals and 8-12 with his three-pointers. ADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad Four of those far-away shots were made in a consecutive manner within the final 3 minutes. By the time the Gold Medal was in his hand, the Golden State Warriors star had emerged as Team USA’s leading scorer, setting an Olympic record for the most three-pointers made in a final game. In light of this, the billion-dollar fast-food brand thought of cracking a joke at the expense of France’s loss. “This is a joke in reference to yesterday’s basketball game and Stephen Curry’s huge performance,” a spokesperson for McDonald’s France stated in an email to CNN.

Join Debate Chef Curry saved Team USA from a loss against Serbia in the semis and was the most influential in the finals victory. Without him, the US basketball team might have had to walk away without a medal, and France might have finished on top. Therefore, by keeping the item on their menu, McDonald’s France may not have wanted to hand out a daily reminder to consumers about the man who cost them their Gold. However, if McDonald’s wants to take the joke further, they can allow the ‘Curry Sauce’ to make an appearance in US locations. With the 2028 Olympics set to take place in LA, fans would need it to remind them of the player who brought the previous medal home. Stephen Curry’s name and the name of the McDonald’s sauce are a simple coincidence. But thanks to their dominance on the NBA court, many basketball athletes have had some specific dishes named after them. Some have been bestowed this honor, while others have just created these food items by themselves. Carmelo Anthony entered the NBA in 2003 as part of one of the most promising draft classes of all time. Later on, he devoted the next 19 years of his life living up to that standard, securing his name in the NBA All-Star team on 10 occasions, winning four medals (three gold, one bronze) at the Olympics, and getting himself named to the NBA 75 anniversary team. However, amongst all these accolades, it would be remiss to not mention the sandwich that Carnegie Deli named especially in his honor. Introduced back in 2011, ‘The Melo’ is a monstrous food item. It is a skyscraper of meats, as it contains over 3.5 pounds of pastrami, salami, corned beef, bacon, and, to keep the sandwich a bit ‘healthy’, lettuce and tomato. Filling one stomach would also drain one’s wallet since, according to CBS News, ‘The Melo’ cost $21.95 when introduced. The reasoning behind the price was based on the fact that selling 3 million of ‘The Melo’ sandwiches would secure $65 million in sales, the same price that cost the New York Knicks in its extension deal with the player. During his stint with the Cleveland Cavaliers, Matthew Dellavedova created a reputation for being a player who would often engage in physical antics on the court. In fact, according to a poll conducted by The Los Angeles Times in 2016, he was ranked as the ‘NBA’s dirtiest player.’ Despite this, he had a thing not many of his peers did: A burger named after him. In May 2015, in order to celebrate National Burger Day and the Cavaliers securing a perfect 4-0 record during the Conference Finals, the Cleveland Cavaliers introduced ‘The Delly Burger.’ Being sold at a concession stand outside the basketball arena, the food item consisted of salami, capicola, provolone, gritty arugula, roasted peppers, and a tough texture of red wine vinaigrette. At $9.75, the burger might not have been that appealing to the eye but would have tasted different. In honor of #NationalBurgerDay & East Champs @cavs, our star #DELLYBURGER. @matthewdelly @TheQArena @AramarkSports pic.twitter.com/xTWWYvjk0J — Aramark Corporation (@Aramark) May 28, 2015 Expand Tweet  In 2015, then Charlotte Hornets small forward Michael Kidd-Gilchrist was honored with a burger bearing his name at The Cowfish Sushi Burger Bar, in Charlotte. The turkey burger consisted of a raclette, spinach, fried leeks, and a topping of hot pepper jelly. It will be rare for the NBA world to see a player like Shaquille O’Neal again on the basketball court. If there is one thing that longtime fans know about him, it is that the four-time NBA champion loves food. As a result, he set out to share his love by introducing not just one food item bearing his name, but a whole restaurant! Founded in 2018, the Big Chicken restaurant chain is Shaq’s brainchild. While it was only in 18 locations by June 2023, it is currently expanding at a rapid rate and will operate in over 300 stores soon. Specializing in Louisiana-style fried chicken sandwiches, many of the offerings are named after Shaq himself. Examples include the Shaq Attack, Shaq Daddy, Big Aristotle, Shaq Fu BBQ, and Superman. via Imago Credits: Big Chicken Shaq has also named several sandwiches to honor some of the closest people in his life. One of them includes Philadelphia 76ers legend, Shaq’s former rival, and his recent ‘Inside the NBA’ co-host Charles Barkley. After all, with an item named the ‘Charles Barkley Sandwich’, one would not have to guess hard. ADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad Before the era of Luka Doncic and Co, Dirk Nowitzki was the name Dallas Mavericks fans most resonated with. The player was honored with a dish named after him, ‘The Dirk Burger’. Created in collaboration with Nowitzki and AAC Executive Chef Mark Mabry and launched in 2016, it is a 1/3-pound hamburger placed on a Bavarian pretzel bun. The toppings included jalapeno beer cheese, arugula, bacon onion marmalade, and mustard horseradish aioli. Sold at the Mavericks’ home base of American Airlines Center, ‘The Dirk Burger’ made a re-appearance back in March 2017 in honor of Nowitzki’s quest for 30,000 career points.

York, NY United States – ZUMAp175 20220426_zsa_p175_001 Copyright: xMattxDaviesx Should Nike elevate Kobe Bryant's brand to the same legendary status as Michael Jordan's? The United States men’s basketball team clinched gold for the fifth consecutive time by defeating France on Saturday night in the 2024 Paris Olympics. Although busy with training for the Mike Tyson fight on November 15th, Jake Paul made time to watch Team USA succeed in the biggest games of the world. Meanwhile, he came up with the idea that the sports apparel brand Nike should sign more players to the Kobe Bryant brand. Such an idea is not a new thing Paul came up with alone—fans of the late NBA legend have made similar demands in the past. Jake Paul happens to be a more headline-friendly sort of person. It’s worth noting, that Nike’s Kobe brand, launched in 2005, is a line of basketball shoes and other merchandise created in collaboration with Bryant, one of the greatest NBA players of all time. It includes signature sneakers, apparel, and accessories. Regardless, Paul wants Nike to build a brand around Bryant like they did for Michael Jordan in 1997. All this transpired on social media, as Paul roped in Kobe’s wife Vanessa Bryant in the loop. ADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad While watching the Summer Olympics’ last basketball game, Paul hopped onto X and wrote, “Nike needs to sign players to the Kobe brand, just like Jordan. Seeing so many men and women ball players wearing Kobe’s at the Olympics. 8-10-24- let’s get that gold for Mamba.” He isn’t wrong. Many of the Olympic basketball players were sporting Bryant’s retro Nikes during many of the games. Is Jake Paul right to demand Nike treat Kobe's brand like Michael Jordan's? React! Reactions     A post shared by betr (@betr)  If that doesn’t convince you, here’s more: Even though Nike’s only released retro models so far, the Kobe line is still the most popular performance basketball shoe out there. And the good news? Nike’s already making moves in the right direction. They relaunched the ‘Kobe Brand’ last August, with more sneaker drops and ‘Mamba Programs’ in the NCAA. Still, Nike hasn’t fully created a Kobe brand like Jordan Brand just yet. Plus, if Nike does decide to, Kobe’s wife Vanessa Bryant should have the final say, according to Jake Paul. After Paul put his thoughts out there, he soon clarified his stance, adding, “Meant with full respect and admiration. Of course it’s Vanessa Bryant who has to make that decision.” The posts were then shared together by Paul’s sports betting app Betr’s Instagram page. Interestingly, when Jordan launched his sub-label in 1997, it included signing five NBA players, which later expanded into NFL and MLB. And this isn’t the first time Paul’s shown his love and respect for the late NBA legend. ADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad Back in January, Jake Paul opened up about the mix of emotions he felt during his professional boxing debut, which happened at a pretty tough time for sports fans. On January 26, 2020, the world was hit hard by the devastating news of NBA legend Kobe Bryant’s tragic death, along with his daughter Gigi and seven others, in a helicopter crash. As Paul was gearing up for his first pro fight that same week, he couldn’t help but feel the weight of the loss, especially since Kobe was admired worldwide for his ‘Mamba Mentality’ and unstoppable work ethic. My first pro debut’s fight week started on Jan 26, 2020. It was a very sad way to start my boxing career. Since then I’ve looked to learn from Kobe Bryant work ethic / Mamba mentality daily. Legends are forever. Rest in peace. pic.twitter.com/uBcYYVEHJP — Jake Paul (@jakepaul) January 26, 2024 Expand Tweet  ADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad In a touching post on X, Paul talked about how Bryant’s legacy has been a huge inspiration for him, shaping the way he approaches his boxing career. Even though that week was heavy with grief, Paul managed to push through and came out on top in his debut, defeating fellow YouTuber AnEsonGib with a first-round TKO. Looking back, Jake Paul paid tribute to Bryant, recognizing how much the basketball icon’s influence still drives him both in life and in the ring. Despite the lack of a complete brand around Kobe Bryant, every time Nike drops Bryant sneakers, the demand is difficult to keep up with. Meaning, it’s safe to say that it won’t be an unprofitable endeavor for Nike. Still, whether such a thing happens is yet to be seen. Would you like to see Nike sign players to the Kobe Brand?

After the final whistle at the Paris Olympics echoed through the city, most athletes sunk into much-needed rest. But for the dynamic father-son duo of Carmelo Anthony and Kiyan, the action was just heating up. Fresh off watching the basketball gold medal games in Paris, the 10× NBA All-Star and his son made a swift return to New York to catch another epic final—this time at Nike’s ‘NY vs NY’ tournament. A recent video shared by The Score on Instagram had fans buzzing. The caption read, “Druski was HYPED to meet Melo 🤣🤝,” capturing the excitement of American comedian and actor Druski as he greeted Carmelo Anthony at the event. The brief clip quickly went viral, showcasing the light-hearted moment between the two celebrities, with Druski clearly star-struck.   ADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad     A post shared by theScore (@thescore) Is Carmelo Anthony the ultimate basketball dad? React! Reactions  Although 3× Olympic gold medalist Melo was undoubtedly a significant presence at the event, it was Druski who stole the show as he crowned the champions of the court. The players from Dyckman emerged victorious against Uptown, clinching the title in a hard-fought battle. Nike’s ‘NY vs NY’ official page highlighted this moment with a video post, stating, “NEW CHAMPS HAVE BEEN CROWNED 👑 DYCKMAN CAPS A PHENOMENAL SEASON WITH A BIG WIN OVER UPTOWN. ONE STORY ENDS. ANOTHER ONE BEGINS. ✍” Of course, Melo wasn’t the only NBA personality to grace the tournament. Just days earlier, Nike celebrated hoops and sneaker culture at ‘NY vs NY’ with appearances from Memphis Grizzlies star Ja Morant. Earlier this year, other NBA stars like Ben Simmons, Tim Hardaway Jr., and Kyrie Irving also made an appearance at the tournament. Interestingly, while Carmelo was making his rounds, Kiyan was notably absent by his side—at least for a while. After an hour, the official ‘NY vs NY’ page on Instagram became active with a post that said: NO 1 NAME IN NYC IS REPPING BIG BROOKLYN 🍿🍿🍿 KIYAN IS IN THE BUILDING. But why Kiyan is the “No.1 name in NYC“? ADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad ESPN ranked Kiyan Anthony, son of NBA legend Carmelo Anthony and actress La La Anthony, as the top high school basketball recruit in New York State for the class of 2025. The young shooting guard is making waves, not just locally, but nationally, securing the 40th spot overall in his high school class. Moreover, Kiyan’s performances on the court are backing up the hype. According to Vibe.com, the rising star dropped 42 points in one game and 35 in another at the NBPA Top 100 Camp, showcasing his scoring prowess. His stellar play has caught the eye of top Division I programs, with schools like Indiana, Michigan, Florida State, and Syracuse extending offers. Interestingly, Syracuse, where his father famously won a national championship in 2003, seems to be a standout option. In 2023, Kiyan even made an official visit to Syracuse, posing in a jersey alongside his father, sparking rumors that he might follow in Melo’s footsteps. Though he hasn’t committed to any school yet, the idea of continuing his father’s legacy at Syracuse is generating plenty of excitement and speculation.

Pau Gasol,Team USA's Kobe Bryant forgot Pau Gasol was his Lakers teammate during 2008 Olympics and ran through him in true sign of 'Mamba Mentality',https://talksport.com/sport/1914025/team-usa-kobe-bryant-pau-gasol-lakers-olympics/,"Kobe Bryant was known around the world as 'The Black Mamba'. It was moniker inspired after the late, great Los Angeles Lakers legend watched Quentin Tarantino's 'Kill Bill' and needed something to separate himself from his on-court persona. In the film, the black mamba snake, known for its agility and aggressiveness, was used as a code name for a deadly assassin. It was nickname befitting of one of the most competitive players to ever suit up in the NBA. In 2008, Bryant and the rest of Team USA were looking for revenge. Four years prior, they'd been embarrassed at the Olympic Games in Athens, finishing with a bronze medal. 16 years earlier, the original 'Dream Team', led by Hall of Famers Michael Jordan, Charles Barkley, Larry Bird and Magic Johnson, destroyed everyone en route to Olympic gold and set the standard for all subsequent teams to aspire to. While the '04 team was no Dream Team, it was still a star-studded squad bursting with NBA talent, and a third place finish on the world stage was simply unforgivable. Team USA needed to salvage its global standing. It had to re-claim gold in 2008. Their solution?  Bring in reigning MVP Kobe Bryant, who had never played in the Olympics before but was seething after an NBA Finals defeat to bitter rivals Boston and was desperate to see the US reestablish themselves atop the international basketball food chain. 'The Redeem Team' had found its leader, one that could take a talented but inexperienced group including Carmelo Anthony, Dwyane Wade and LeBron James, and turn them into ruthless winners. Team USA headed to Beijing, China, in the summer of '08 as the overwhelming favourites, but reigning world champions Spain were still the team to beat. After blowout wins against China, Angola and Greece, Team USA faced Spain in a preliminary round game. Both teams were undefeated thus far (3-0), but one narrative in particular dominated the build up to the contest. Kobe vs Pau. Earlier that year, 7-footer Gasol had been traded to Los Angeles to play alongside Bryant and fill the Lakers' Shaq-sized hole that had been gaping for years. The big-man-little-man combo immediately hit it off, forming an potent partnership that saw them finish the season 27–9 and reach the NBA Finals. Ahead of the game vs Spain, Bryant told reporters that he and Gasol 'are like brothers' and that going against each other wouldn't be easy. ""I'm very happy for him that he's playing well,"" Bryant said. ""I mean, we're very, very tight, so it's a little tough to compete against him."" His locker room message was one of an entirely different tone. ""Kobe said he was gonna set the tone to start the game and he said, 'I'm running through Pau's chest',"" LeBron revealed in Netflix's Redeem Team documentary. James said the US players responded: ""Man, you tripping. That's your teammate. You tripping. You ain't about to do this."" ""First play of the game I'm running through Pau Gasol.' And we was like, 'What?'"" Dwyane Wade added.  ""He said, 'First play of the game, I know what they're gonna run.' And he knew Pau was gonna be the last screen and he said 'I'm running through him'."" Sure enough, Spain ran the play Bryant was expecting in the first few minutes of the contest. Gasol attempted to set a screen on Bryant, who ran straight through him at full force and knocked him over to the ground. Bryant was called for the foul and stood over his Lakers teammate as a bewildered Gasol looked around as if to check what had just happened. Kobe had sent a message, not just to Pau and Spain, but to his own teammates, without uttering a single word. ""He was like, 'No, he ain't my teammate right now. F**k him. Get up,'"" Carmelo Anthony said. ""I’m like, I love this energy. This is what we need right now."" ""He just went right into the middle of my chest, tried to get right through me to send a message,"" Gasol explained in the documentary. ""Not just to me, but to his teammates to say, 'Hey, this might be my brother. I play with him. We're close. But I don't care about anything else but winning.'"" ""We was like, 'Oh, ain't no way we're losing this game,” LeBron added. “We about to beat the sh*t out of Spain.” Team USA went on to cruise to a 37-point victory with Bryant finishing with 11 points in only 16 minutes of action. The United States and Spain met again in the gold medal game in what turned out to be a much closer affair. Kobe hit big shots down the stretch and finished with 20 points as the Redeem Team clinched a 118-107 victory. Bryant had set out what he achieved to do, winning gold for Team USA and avenging the humiliation of 2004. The way he'd done it, embodying his 'Mamba Mentality' -- 'attacking what's in front of you with passion and purpose, without fear and doubt' -- was what made it so special. Inadvertently, he'd also helped Gasol and the Lakers. ""I sincerely believed Pau benefited from the collision more than anyone else,"" Michael Lee of The Washington Post told Netflix.  ""He got to see how intensely Kobe approached the game and it helped him develop the mentality he was going to need to go back to back. ""The Lakers were going to be good, but they wouldn't be great by being happy-go-lucky."" The team from Tinseltown won consecutive titles with Bryant and Gasol leading the way, beating the Magic in 2009 and the Celtics in 2010. Bryant rejoined the national team for the 2012 Summer Olympics and won another gold meal, his second overall.  He finished his national team career with a record of 26–0 across three tournaments (including the USA FIBA Americas Championship), winning a gold medal each time. His international peak undoubtedly came in 2008 though, when the entire world saw what 'Mamba Mentality' was all about. For Gasol, that was as good as - if not better - than anything the original Dream Team ever did. ""Kobe came and they brought their A-Team,"" he said. ""I think that was probably as good or better than the potentially original dream team, if you ask me"". Gasol is one of the greatest international players in NBA history, winning two titles alongside Bryant. The Spanish big man was a six-time All-Star and NBA Rookie of the Year, He also has an illustrious international career having won a FIBA World Cup title, three EuroBasket titles, two Olympic silver medals, and an Olympic bronze medal.

Djokovic and Alcaraz are not short athletes by any means. However, they were still ridiculed on Reddit by the users for their height difference when compared to NBA players.

Magic Johnson,"Vanessa Bryant, Magic Johnson, and More Celebrate as Dennis Rodman’s Daughter Wins 1st Olympic Gold With Team USA",https://www.essentiallysports.com/nba-legends-basketball-news-soccer-news-vanessa-bryant-magic-johnson-and-more-celebrate-as-dennis-rodmans-daughter-wins-first-olympic-gold-with-team-usa/,"More Sports ES Fancast Aug 10, 2024 | 11:49 PM EDT via Imago Credits: IMAGO via Imago Credits: IMAGO Trinity Rodman wins gold—Is she surpassing her father's legendary legacy already? The mood at the Rodman household must be electric right now. After all, Trinity Rodman, daughter of NBA legend Dennis Rodman, just helped the U.S. women’s national soccer team clinch their first Olympic gold medal in 12 years. Certainly, the basketball fraternity wouldn’t miss out on recognizing the feat and the talent. On August 10, in a game that kept everyone on the edge of their seats, the U.S. defeated Brazil 1-0. The first and only goal of the game came from Mallory Swanson, one of the three on the new coach, Emma Hayes’ front three alongside Sophia Smith and Rodman. Earlier this week, Trinity Rodman, Swanson, and Smith appeared on TODAY, where they proudly introduced their new moniker, ‘Triple Espresso.’ 5× NBA champion’s daughter explained, “We have a proposal for our trio name to be ‘Triple Espresso.’ So we’re going to put that out into the air and let people run with that, because we like that as well.” Although fans and players have also given the trio nicknames like “The Trident” and “Holy Trinity,” it’s clear that ‘Triple Espresso’ is the name that is sticking with them. ADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad However, it wasn’t just ‘Triple Espresso’ that made this victory possible. Goalkeeper Alyssa Naeher delivered a game-saving performance, especially with a one-handed save on Adriana’s header in stoppage time. This marked the third occasion where the U.S. emerged victorious against Brazil in an Olympic final, with previous wins in 2004 in Athens and 2008 in Beijing. Did Dennis Rodman's daughter just make her dad proud or what? React! Reactions Watching the moment live were Mission Impossible star Tom Cruise and former U.S. soccer star Megan Rapinoe herself. But celebrations were certainly not limited to courtside. As the US women’s soccer team secured only the 5th Olympic medal of the program, USA hype-man this Summer Games and Dennis Rodam’s brief rival, Magic Johnson, were quick to jump in to congratulate.“Congratulations to the US Women’s Soccer team on beating Brazil to win the gold this morning!!🥇” he wrote on X. Congratulations to the US Women’s Soccer team on beating Brazil to win the gold this morning!!🥇 — Earvin Magic Johnson (@MagicJohnson) August 10, 2024 Expand Tweet  Rodam, who shared the court with Kobe Bryant in 1999, also saw the LA Lakers‘ icon’s widow, Venessa, extending her cheers over the win – keeping alive not just the Kobe-Dennis bond but also the one he shared with his daughter. Posting an image of Trinity Rodman and her teammates on her Instagram story, she captioned, “GOLD.”  Kobe left a huge impact on Trinity when he reminded her that “women are capable of being as successful, if not more successful, than men.” She revealed that it motivated her to continue playing soccer. She had seemingly met Kobe through his daughter Natalia, whom she played on the same team with as a six-year-old. So the eldest of the Bryant daughters also celebrated the win, posting a photo of the ‘Triple Espresso’ trio with their gold medals.

She shared a stat graphic highlighting how the team has returned to its winning ways. Finally, back in the Rodman family, Trinity’s brother, Dennis Rodman Jr., who is following in his father’s footsteps by playing college basketball at USC, shared an image of Trinity and her teammates, captioning it, “Gold for you!! @trinity_rodman.” Trinity ended her Olympic run with three goals, one assist, and tallying 46 caps for the senior team.

Magic Johnson,"Dream Team’s Michael Jordan, Charles Barkley and Magic Johnson showed ultimate act of loyalty during ’92 Olympics with defiant act during gold medal ceremony",https://talksport.com/sport/1951106/michael-jordan-barkley-magic-dream-team-olympics-nike-reebok/,"Michael Jordan is Nike. Nike is Michael Jordan. The most marketable athlete in the history of North American sports has been intertwined with the venerated Swoosh brand ever since he put pen to paper on a five-year, $2.5-million endorsement deal in 1984. Mike and Nike's relationship eventually birthed the iconic 'Air Jordan' sneakers, a landmark shoe that became a major status symbol in footwear and streetwear culture around the globe. Nike's ascendancy from Oregon-based shoe brand to multi-billion dollar apparel corporation coincided with His Airness rising to the summit of The Association. By 1992, two-time champion and two-time Finals MVP Jordan had surpassed Magic Johnson and Larry Bird as the undisputed face of the NBA, and was about to take his talents overseas. NBA initially players weren't allowed to participate in the Olympics, but that all changed in 1989 when FIBA removed the rule. So, in 1992, Team USA head coach Chuck Daily assembled an Avengers-esqe squad bursting with NBA talent that was tasked with one simple goal: winning an Olympic gold medal. Jordan, Magic and Bird were joined by fellow Hall of Famers Charles Barkley, David Robinson, Karl Malone, and Patrick Ewing, among others, who descended on Barcelona, Spain with Beatles-like fanfare and with the mission of putting on a basketball clinic. The star-studded squad was aptly named the Dream Team because of their ethereal talents, and they predictably stomped on every team who dared to step in their way. The consensus greatest sports team ever assembled were unbeaten en route to the gold medal that summer, averaging more than 117 points per game and winning by an average margin of 44 points. Team USA defeated Croatia 117-85 in the gold medal game and Nike ambassador Jordan was suddenly faced with a difficult dilemma. Brand rival Reebok had secured exclusive rights to produce warm-up outfits and other apparel for American athletes, including Dream Team members, at the '92 Olympics. Reebok reportedly paid $4 million for the rights to Team USA’s medal stand jackets and the US Olympic Committee made it clear that winners had to accept medals while wearing jackets emblazoned with the Reebok logo. ""[They] said if we don’t wear our uniforms, we can’t accept our gold medal,” Jordan said at the time. But it wasn't just MJ's brand loyalties that were about to be tested. Of the 12 Dream Team members, none were Reebok endorsers, while six, including Jordan and Barkley, were Nike athletes. US co-captains Magic and Bird were longtime Converse advocates. Something had to give, and it was increasingly apparent that none of the players were about to jeopardize highly lucrative sponsorship deals by rocking a rival brand in front of millions of eyes. And so, as they went up to the podium to receive their gold medals, all 12 Dream Team players unzipped their jackets so that the collars obscured the Reebok sponsor patch. Jordan, the trailblazer that he is, went one step further. The Chicago Bulls legend covered the Reebok logo on the right shoulder by draping himself in the red, white and blue of the American flag. “They can’t hide it like I’m gonna hide it,"" Jordan said. ""They in for a big f***ing surprise."" Barkley and Magic were the only other players who followed suit and covered the Reebok insignia with the American flag. “Us Nike guys are loyal to Nike because they pay us a lot of money,” Sir Charles told reporters at the time. “I have 2 million reasons not to wear Reebok.” Jordan, Barkley, and Magic's defiant stance worked like a charm. There wasn't a Reebok patch in sight when The Star-Spangled Banner rang out around the Spanish arena. Straight after the medal ceremony had taken place, Jordan tossed the Reebok jacket to Brian McIntyre, a member of the NBA’s public relations squad, telling him he could have it. ""I certainly don't want it,"" he told McIntyre. McIntyre looked after the jacket - which has a patch that reads 'Reebok is proud to honor America’s finest' - for two years, thinking Jordan would eventually want it back. In 1994, McIntyre bumped into MJ at an event and tried to hand the item back to him. Instead, Jordan signed it: “To Brian, Thanks for Everything, Michael Jordan."" McIntyre kept the jacket for nearly 30 years. It remains a timeless piece of basketball memorabilia, and in 2023, sold through Sotheby's for $1.5 million. The jacket is so much more than 'just' a piece of memorabilia, though. It's an important artefact that serves as a powerful reminder of the enduring strength of brand Jordan and his unparalleled impact on sports, fashion and culture. “Everyone agreed we would not deface the Reebok on the award uniform,” Jordan said of the decision to cover up the jacket at the time. “The American flag cannot deface anything. That’s what we stand for. The American dream is standing up for what you believe in. I believed in it, and I stood up for it. If I offended anyone, that’s too bad. ""When you hire 12 Clint Eastwoods to come in here and do a job, don't ask them what bullets they're putting in the gun.""

Kyrie Irving,"Ex-Warrior Star Delves Into Why Tyrese Haliburton & Derrick White Fit Paris Olympics Squad Better Than Jaylen Brown, Kyrie Irving",https://www.essentiallysports.com/nba-active-basketball-news-ex-golden-state-warriors-star-delves-into-why-tyrese-haliburton-and-derrick-white-fit-paris-olympics-squad-better-than-jaylen-brown-kyrie-irving/,"More Sports ES Fancast Aug 8, 2024 | 2:08 AM EDT Derrick White over Kyrie Irving for the Olympics—smart move or a huge mistake? USA Basketball’s selection process for the 2024 Paris Olympics hasn’t pleased many. The community, in the last few weeks, has witnessed memorable moments, snubs, and big-time controversies, we tell you. Along with bringing back LeBron James after he last played in 2012, Steph Curry and Anthony Edwards also made it to the roster. The issue arose when Derrick White was sent as Kawhi’s replacement instead of Jaylen Brown. 2016 gold medallist Kyrie Irving was also excluded, with 8 years younger Tyrese Haliburton. Despite the uproar and Draymond criticizing his own GSW coach, another ex-Warrior believes that what happened was for the best. DeMarcus Cousins and Quinn Cook discussed Tyrese Haliburton’s inclusion in the Team USA roster. Quinn initiated the topic, stating, “You need a guy who’s not gonna be mad when not playing.” This was an indirect dig at Jaylen Brown, as the Team USA roster was reportedly concerned whether “someone of Jaylen Brown’s caliber would accept having a significantly reduced role.” Therefore, with the team filled with dominating scorers like LeBron, KD, etc, the need was for a player who wouldn’t mind staying on the sidelines. “Obviously, Jaylen Brown, Kyrie Irving, from a talent perspective, and what they’ve done, even with their resumes, they’re supposed to be on the team. But when you’re putting a team together, just sometimes you need your Derrick White,” Quinn Cook said on Above The Rim with DH 12. “The topic of the basketball world has been ‘Jayson Tatum not playing’, yeah. If Derrick White don’t play, that’s expected.” ADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad Being the second-in-command in their respective franchises, both Jaylen Brown and Kyrie Irving are expected to carry the offensive effort, which grants them more on-court minutes. During the NBA Finals between the Boston Celtics and the Dallas Mavericks, Brown averaged 38.5 minutes throughout five games, while Irving averaged 39 minutes. While Derrick White himself wasn’t that far behind with his average of 36.7 minutes, his scoring wasn’t on par with that of his Celtics teammate and Mavericks rival.

Join Debate via Reuters Paris 2024 Olympics – Team USA Basketball arrivals at USA House – Team USA House, Paris, France – August 05, 2024. Derrick White of United States arrives at the USA House. REUTERS/Tingshu Wang During the 2016 Rio Olympics, Kyrie Irving went on to average 22.2 minutes over 8 games, with 17 minutes being used up to add only 4 points in the Finals against Serbia. In contrast, LeBron James has averaged 20.5 minutes at the Paris Olympics, while Kevin Durant just 19.6. Therefore, Irving’s previous record of taking up a bulk of the minutes, which may or may not generate the required points, may have played a role in his exclusion. After Jaylen Brown hinted that his exclusion from Team USA was because of his sour relationship with Nike, the team’s managing director Grant Hill was quick to come out with a response. He went on to state that “the responsibility that I have is to put together a team and a team that complements each other.” He had to decide on these grounds, even if it meant not taking in “Finals MVP.” As highlighted by Quinn Cook, the management simply may not have believed that taking in Jaylen Brown and/or Kyrie Irving would have been worthwhile if they had just remained on the sidelines. Another ex-NBA player, however, had a stronger reasoning, siding with the Celt’s Nike agenda and providing more reasons for the same. Now that we’ve opened this can of worms, let’s dive deeper. After Jaylen Brown made headlines for blaming Nike, reactions started to pour in from all sides. Many former NBA players, including Gilbert Arenas and Rashad McCants, agreed with the Celtics star’s sentiment. During a segment of his ‘Gil’s Arena’ podcast, the Wizards legend even went on to state that Team USA was allegedly a Nike Event that just sidelined players who aren’t a part of the billion-dollar brand. McCants highlighted that both players were, at one point in time, associated with the brand until complications arose. “Jaylen Brown sided with Kyrie Irving. He spoke out against Nike dropping Kyrie,” said McCants. “Nike dropped Kyrie after the post, Jaylen Brown didn’t like that, I think he was the President of the Players’ Association at the time, he was obligated to speak out about what Nike did, why they did it, he didn’t like it. He was wearing Kobes at the time, so he started covering up his Kobes.” USA Today via Reuters Jun 6, 2024; Boston, Massachusetts, USA; Boston Celtics guard Jaylen Brown (7) looks on in the third quarter against the Dallas Mavericks during game one of the 2024 NBA Finals at TD Garden. Mandatory Credit: David Butler II-USA TODAY Sports Back in 2022, Kyrie Irving suffered from repercussions after he posted antisemitic content online. This involved the Nets suspending him, and Nike ending the endorsement deal that they signed with the player in 2014. By that point, it had been 3 years since Irving had left the Celtics, and much of the Boston fanbase had turned against the player. ADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad Despite this, Brown, in his capacity as VP of the NBA Players Association, stated his disagreement with the terms that Irving needed to fulfill for his franchise suspension to be revoked. When it came to Nike, Brown took to his official X account, and wrote, “Since when did Nike care about ethics?” This, according to reports, is what soured the relationship between Nike and the 2024 NBA champion. After Grant Hill went on to state that Brown blaming Nike was just a ‘conspiracy theory’, the Celt had to remind him that as VP of the NBA Players Association, he has “a great understanding” of how things work. Brown and Irving may have been excluded from the 2024 roster simply because of the playing minutes issue. However, no one can deny the ‘fishy-ness’ that this happened with the duo, who were not on good terms with Nike.

Blake Griffin,“Blake Griffin... Was Like a Monster”: Shaq’s Former Agent Says Michael Jordan Talk Not Anthony Edwards’ Biggest Concern,https://www.essentiallysports.com/nba-active-basketball-news-blake-griffin-was-like-a-monster-shaqs-former-agent-says-michael-jordan-talk-not-anthony-edwards-biggest-concern/,"More Sports ES Fancast Jun 14, 2024 | 9:15 AM EDT Anthony Edwards’ season ended in the Western Conference Finals, but by all accounts, he had a breakout year. And how! Comparisons to Michael Jordan started following him everywhere. It’s not about his stunning vertical, scary offensive maneuvers, or even trash talk. Charismatic confidence and the talent to back it up are very subtle Jordan-esque traits he displays. He’s played it humble on the MJ topic so far, but you can see him riding on it. Or at least social media can’t look past it. His Kobe Bryant-inspired Adidas campaign gave Jordan vibes to most, but is it taking away from Ant’s identity? Vishal Kolar asked Leonard Armato, the brand-builder to the pros like Shaq, just that on his second sit-down with EssentiallySports. It’s easy to throw out MJ comparisons but Kolar asked if this is damaging to Antman’s brand and his dreams to be the future face of the league. As per Armato, it’s a fine line. Armato: “I don’t think he has to take the bait on it. If people want to compare him to Michael Jordan, let ’em. All he has to do is say, ‘Jordan is one of a kind and I have ultimate respect for him.’ I think Anthony Edwards is sort of a different kind of guy, fun, young, certainly youthful in so many different aspects of his personality, explosive and incredibly fun to watch.” ADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad Edwards has the desire to be the face of the league. In all aspects, he’s getting there but it won’t be immediately. Jordan was a star before the championships but it was only when he led the Chicago Bulls to the Finals for the first time that national networks took the NBA as a prime-time commodity, expanded sponsorships, and even influenced fashion when it could be said that His Airness was the true face of the league. Before Edwards can get there, he has to be consistent and healthy. Armato: “It’ll be interesting to see how his career evolves. He hasn’t gotten to the promised land yet. He certainly is looking forward to getting there. I don’t know if it will be this year but if he perseveres, if he stays healthy, he could have an incredible career. But you don’t know, I mean look, people get injured at times, you never know. Look at Blake Griffin. The guy was like a monster, and then he had those injuries and really did debilitate him.” “There’s a lot of people who’ve suffered injuries, especially high flyers. And you’ve seen some of the things he’s done. It’s scary. I mean, he’s fallen on his back, blocking shots, and you’re wondering if he’s okay. So, let’s just see how this thing evolves. Certainly, he’s super fun to watch. He’s a charismatic kid. And, you know, underneath it all, he’s a bit in his show-off stuff, but at the same time, I think he’s got a good heart and he’s a good kid, and people really like him.” Armato is right that the ‘high flyers’ like Edwards are at high risk. He’s been severely prone to injuries, but when push comes to shove, he cannot sit down. He has to perform and lead his team. Edwards embraces the pain and plays through that, with the bravest of smiles. Hip injuries, twisting his ankle, fingers, and knees, anything and everything, yet he puts his best foot forward on the court. ADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad During Game 6 against the Denver Nuggets, Edwards had a scary fall on his back. They won Game 6 and assured fans he’d still play. The Wolves won the series in Game 7 and Armato was looking forward to the Conference Finals at the time of the interview, which they ended up losing. Even though Minnesota fans were disappointed by that defeat, fans still had a lot of fun watching him play. Armato elevates Edwards’ “good heart” which not enough people talk about. He’s engaging in an interview and not a braggart as he seems on court. AntMan initially accepted the MJ talk gracefully but in May, he flat out said, “I want it to stop.” He explained his reasoning. “He’s the greatest of all time. I can’t be compared to him.” ADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad Even the greatest aren’t immune, though. Michael Jordan was 22 during the infamous broken foot season in 1985. Edwards entered the NBA at 19 and is 22 now making veterans reminisce rookie Jordan. You don’t have to re-watch The Last Dance to know it wasn’t easy for Jordan to overcome that setback and very few have replicated such a comeback. The comparisons will be nothing unless Edwards maintains his physical condition and longevity.

Wesley Sneijder,The Man United transfer saga involving ex-Real Madrid ace Jose Mourinho loved who 'could have been as good as Lionel Messi',https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/transfer-news/manchester-united-sneijder-scholes-ferguson-27577462,"Manchester United have been embroiled in their fair share of transfer sagas. Even in his short time in the Old Trafford hot seat Erik ten Hag has encountered such issues, with his prolonged pursuit of Frenkie de Jong rarely far from the back pages but ultimately unsuccessful. Some other names have become almost running jokes among the fanbase as the Reds have been linked with them every time the transfer window opens. There was a time when Wesley Sneijder fell into that category. At the time, Paul Scholes was heading into the twilight of his career. The Class of '92 graduate was heading for a career break in 2011 before coming out of retirement in 2012 for 18 months. Sir Alex Ferguson knew a replacement would need to be brought to the club. ALSO READ: Ten Hag needs to solve a problem Ferguson admitted to having at United During this period, Sneijder was one of the most gifted and talked about midfielders in world football, evening once claiming he could have been as good as Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo. He had helped Jose Mourinho's Inter Milan win the Treble in the 2009/10 season before playing an important role in the Netherlands' run to the World Cup final. With United's need for a new central midfielder and Sneijder's reputation, it's no surprise that the Reds were linked with a move. In July 2011, the Daily Mail ran a story regarding the Dutchman which stated he had agreed a £35m transfer. A month later the move was off. But where does the truth lie regarding the Sneijder to United transfer saga? MEN Sport has taken a look. In the eyes of United's legendary manager, a deal for Sneijder was never on the table. During United's pre-season tour of the US in 2011, Ferguson told ESPN: ""I keep reading about this. There’s absolutely nothing at all to that."" The blunt response to a transfer rumour from Ferguson was no surprise. The boss never had time for gossip. Indeed, the Scot doubled down on his reply 10 years later. ""That's come up a lot of times but we were never interested in Sneijder,"" he explained. ""I don't know where that came from but you get a lot of them."" Sneijder has a very different recollection of United's reported interest in him. Shortly after joining Galatasaray in 2013, the midfielder opened up on the legendary manager having talks with his team. ""We had some talks with Alex Ferguson back in 2010,"" he told Galatasaray Dergisi. ""[United] contacted them [Inter] after our Treble season but too much money was asked for. And I was also happy at Inter so I decided to stay. ""Manchester United are a fantastic club and they kept showing interest after that year but not as determined as before. I don't give much thought about proposed transfers. If I'm happy somewhere, I'm happy there."" Fast forward to 2023 and Sneijder had passed the blame away from Inter and towards his own agent. “Well, actually, I was close in 2011,"" Sneijder told SPORTbible. ""I was close in 2011 after the Champions League and after the World Cup. But then, what I heard later is that because at a certain point, we were talking with United and at a certain point there was nothing anymore. United's Adidas home shirt is made up of the same colour of the city's iconic red rose and features a black collar. The collar also features a dash of both red and white, giving it a slick and modernised look. Prices start from £55 ""And I asked my manager, 'What happened with United?' And he said, 'No, nothing, it’s over'. But two years later, I found out that he asked for extra money for himself. So that's why the deal was over. So actually, Ferguson, he told one of my relatives."" As always with transfer speculation, the truth lies somewhere in the middle. Interest from United at the time does make sense, Sneijder fit the bill for what Ferguson would have wanted. However, it is also likely the deal never got close if Sneijder's agent was looking for a bigger cut than was being agreed. Ferguson was renowned for having little time for agents who were, for want of a better phrase, too big for their boots. If what Sneijder explained regarding his manager was true, it is unsurprising Ferguson never saw the midfielder as a solid addition to the squad. Like with many stars, the Dutchman's failed move is another 'what if' moment in United's storied history.

Damian Lillard,Damian Lillard & NBA World Fired Up After Kyrie Irving Honors Father Drederick’s Legacy With $29.98 Billion Company,https://www.essentiallysports.com/nba-active-basketball-news-damian-lillard-nba-world-fired-up-after-kyrie-irving-honors-father-dredericks-legacy-with-twenty-nine-billion-company/,"More Sports ES Fancast Jun 4, 2024 | 9:28 PM EDT Kyrie Irving won people’s hearts ahead of the NBA Finals. The Mavs star guard went through a rough patch in the last few years with controversies circling his head. These controversies eventually stripped away his Nike deal, and he was forced to play without a sponsor briefly. Until Irving signed a $120 million contract with Anta, a Chinese sports brand with a net worth of $29.98 billion! Infamously known as a troublemaker, he’s been on a good run lately. He doubled it down with a sweet gesture to his father, Drederick. Uncle Drew signed up his dad as the first Anta signature athlete. Following the honor, the hoops community swarmed in to appreciate the former NBA Champion. Notably, Damian Lillard took to his Instagram stories, shared the announcement, and wrote, “Fire.” The hoop nations’ famous shooting coach, Chris Matthews A. K. A Lethal Shooter, also expressed his appreciation. He wrote, “I love this. Genius.” Jared Dudley and Austin Rivers also joined the bandwagon and expressed their appreciation with a flurry of ‘fire’ emojis.     A post shared by Shams Charania (@shamsnba) ADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad  Kyrie Irving didn’t just sign up for any other usual deal but created history. Shams Charania, in his post, wrote, “This marks the first time in pro sports a player has signed his dad to a signature shoe deal.” The Mavs guard, who had signed a 5-year deal with Anta, also became the Chief Creative Officer of the brand. With that privilege, he has the power to recruit professional players, celebrities, influential figures, and artists into the company. The 8x All-Star took the opportunity to honor his father. Moreover, Drederick Irving isn’t new to the sport. The 58-year-old had played at Boston University before lacing up professional basketball in Australia. In the league of Jordans and LeBrons, Kyrie Irving’s signature line was a pretty big deal amongst the sneakerheads. Moreover, Nike was all set to launch The Kyrie 8 shoes before everything came crashing down. Irving turned into a public enemy No.1 in no time! In early 2022, the star guard shared a link to a documentary via his X handle, which was against the political beliefs of the league and Nike. ADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad Kai not only was suspended but also lost his deal with the global sports brand. On top of it, everyone turned their heads against him. After facing an 8-game suspension, Irving returned to the floor only after formally apologizing. But this time, he had to step without the Swish symbol on his sneaker. The star played without a deal for over a year with tapped-up shoes covering the Nike logo. On one fine day in 2023, Kai announced his association with the Chinese brand with a special post on his Instagram. The caption read, “This is truly a full circle moment that I will not take for granted nor underappreciated, given the many obstacles it took to get here.” Indeed, he didn’t take the deal for granted. He reached the NBA Finals and he’s made his dad a part of his success story too. What do you make of Irving’s journey following the Nike saga? Let us know in the comments.

Pelé,Freddy Adu was a Football Manager legend and had a following like Lionel Messi - I almost signed him for Billericay Town,https://talksport.com/football/1958901/freddy-adu-lionel-messi-jamie-ohara-billericay-town/,"Freddy Adu was once touted as the next Pele, he signed a $500k contract at the age of 14... then almost ended up in England's non-league. Football Manager fans will remember just how good Adu was and it was because of the popular game that fans anticipated a special talent on the horizon. In penning his contract at DC United, he became the highest paid MLS player - he was 14 - and the youngest-ever professional athlete in America. Nike were quickly onto this once in a generation talent. Two years later in 2006 he even earned a trial at Manchester United under the watchful eye of Sir Alex Ferguson. ""Freddy has done all right,” Ferguson said of the player, then 17. “He is a talented boy. He'll go back to the US and we'll keep a check on him. When he is 18, we will have to assess what we can do next.” But it turned out to be Adu’s only brush with English football, though not if talkSPORT’s Jamie O’Hara had his way. The former Tottenham midfielder was a former player and manager of the Isthmian League club and admits he was close to signing the player, who had the sort of cult following David Beckham enjoyed in America and which Lionel Messi is now used to. “I nearly signed him at Billericay but we couldn't get him a work permit,” O’Hara confessed on The Sports Bar. He’s still knocking about somewhere, he is still playing.” And what a coup that would have been for the Essex club despite never living up to the high expectation placed on him.  Now aged 35, Adu has been without a club since 2021 and despite never officially retiring from the game he now spends his time coaching kids. Adu enjoyed spells in the United States, Brazil, France, Portugal, Turkey, Serbia, Finland and most recently Sweden. He did play for big teams in Europe, though, like Benfica where he played alongside Angel Di Maria, and Monaco, but says this was a turning point in him becoming a so-called journeyman. ""The one decision I made that I would done differently is when I left Benfica after one year and went on loan to Monaco [in 2008],"" he told CBS Sports. That started the snowball of me having to go on loan from team to team because I wasn't patient enough at Benfica."" As well as acknowledging he could have been more dedicated to becoming the best, Adu cited Di Maria as someone who did remain patient in Portugal. ""A new coach came in, he played and next thing you know he goes to Real Madrid,"" he recalled. ""I go to Monaco and there was a power struggle between coach [Ricardo Gomes] and president - he wanted me really bad but the coach didn't feel like I was ready."" Things may not have gone the way Adu had envisaged for his career but he will be forever cherished as a Football Manager legend. Despite his worldwide acclaim on the game, Adu previously admitted he received barrages of messages from fans.

King Center. Mandatory Credit: Stephen Lew-USA TODAY Sports Is Nike's latest Ja Morant leak a marketing genius or a complete disaster? The Memphis Grizzlies and all their fans are eagerly waiting for the 2024-25 season to start. With a slew of unfortunate incidents to their franchise superstar and other key players, the Grizzlies could never catch a break. But now, with the latest update on Ja Morant, it seems like the season can’t start soon enough. In the meantime, Morant has no plans of leaving his fans stranded as the photos of his latest kicks have taken the internet by storm. The Nike JA 2 “Stargazer” truly does justice to the name. As opposed to his low-top JA 1, the latest shoes feature a higher cut. In addition, the ripple effect detail around the ‘swoosh’ tends to naturally draw the customer’s eyes to the vibrant purple colorway. Couple that with the rumored $120 price point, it’s sure to sell like hotcakes. “Thoughts on Ja Morant’s new shoe? 🤔 Ja Morant’s upcoming Nike Ja 2 has recently surfaced online in a “Stargazer” colorway 👾 @nicekickshoops. The pair is rumored to be releasing in October for $120,” Nicekicks posted on Instagram. ADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad     A post shared by Nice Kicks (@nicekicks)  The Nike JA 1 officially hit the markets in early 2023. Almost a 1.5-year gap certainly makes sense, given the year Morant’s had. Hence, this news comes like a breath of fresh air. However, Coach Taylor Jenkins provided a health update on Ja Morant just a few days earlier. During a recent Summer League broadcast, Jenkins confirmed that Ja was indeed cleared for full basketball activities. “Ja, it’s go time. So very encouraged, medically cleared, full go, crossed all the hurdles. He’s been phenomenal with his rehab. Now it’s full go basketball with him with all the contact. Now it’s been more on the body, getting that back in the right spot. But now he’s full go basketball-wise. We can dive into his basketball plan,” he said. From his 25-game suspension for brandishing a gun to the labrum tear during practice, the season had effectively ended for the 24-year-old. Memphis had seen a steady rise in their rankings in the nine games Morant played in between. Unfortunately, that was it as the Grizzlies finished 13th in the West. But as mentioned above, fans can’t help but be excited to see their young franchise star out on the court. Even so, there are still a few unhappy fans on Instagram who look none-too-pleased with his “Stargazer”. Straight off the bat, this fan put forward a serious argument. “Nike design team and creativity need to have a meeting because seriously this shoe looks like a LeBron mixed with a Kobe lol…” In all honesty, glimpses of probably LeBron XXI and maybe Kobe 5 can be seen. This next fan had one more name to add to the list. “Kobes+Lebrons+Sabrina 2s = Ja 2.” A simple, straightforward equation, which unfortunately once again hits the mark. There’s no denying that the details from these three iconic kicks can be found in JA 2. The prominent swoosh and distinct patterns, not to mention the alluring purple colorway, do not help Nike’s case in the least. In fact, another user has come up with quite a theory for such similarities. “All the Kobe & Kyrie model that got scrapped getting revamped.” We don’t have to tell you the aftermath of Nike terminating their contract with Dallas star guard, Kyrie Irving for his antisemitic comments. So, that subtle dig was also included here. ADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad Andrew Dutton, a sneaker photographer, voiced a complaint that many annoyed fans of the global apparel brand would relate to. “Nothing original coming from Nike basketball rn.” However, this last comment from an individual might leave the Nike PR team confused as to whether it was complimentary or insulting. Or at just the fine line between the two. “How different are y’all expecting a shoe? It’s 20 something Lebron’s and 12 Kobe’s. And y’all expecting a whole new silhouette and design we’ve never seen? Do the shoes look nice or not?” Well … we’ll leave that to you to decide. Do share your insights in the comments.

Steve Nash,List of top 5 Canadian players of all time,https://www.thestar.com/sports/doug-smiths-sports-blog/raptors-mailbag-my-list-of-top-five-canadian-players-of-all-time/article_3be2be42-361e-11ef-9bba-631e3e9dfb20.html," Based on the author’s interpretations and judgments of facts, data and events. With Canada Day weekend upon us, a readers asks who we think are the greatest Canadian basketball players ever. With Canada Day weekend upon us, a readers asks who we think are the greatest Canadian basketball players ever. Canada’s Shai Gilgeous-Alexander drives around Argentina’s Facundo Campazzo at the FIBA Basketball World Cup 2023 Americas Qualifiers in Victoria in 2022. It’s a somewhat abbreviated Ye Olde Mailbag this week, I guess not enough happened and everyone’s getting ready for the Canada Day holiday, Enjoy it and I’m sure there’ll be tons to ask about next week after the NBA free agency period opens. Q: Hi Doug, Not sure what you are planning for the Canada Day weekend mailbag (I hope you personally get a LOT of loafing time in). But given the holiday, and the emergence of Canada as a country that produces a whole lot of really great basketball players, how about a top 5 list of the best Canadian basketball players ever? Happy Canada Day to you and yours. MSG A: That’s a tough one because it covers so many eras and playing styles. But without regard to position, I go with Steve Nash, Shai Gilgeous-Alexander, Jamal Murray, Leo Rautins and Jay Triano. I’m sure I’m missing an obvious one or two but it’s early in the morning as I type and I’ve only had coffee. Q: Hey Doug: Now that the draft is done, I assume you’re preparing for all kinds of drama during the coming free trade frenzy (or maybe no drama at all). Watching the draft, we were constantly told that team X “was on the board” and had five minutes to submit their choice. What happens if the team does not announce their selection within the allotted time? Do they forfeit their pick? There are 30 teams in the league, with 30 first-round picks but only 58 second-round picks. Why? Of the four draft picks the Raptors selected, do you expect all four to spend the whole year in Mississauga? While no one today knows how they will develop over the coming months, which one(s) do you think are likely to spend some considerable time with the Raptors? Philip U A: I ended up typing short stories on my phone while a passenger to a family wedding Friday night and that wasn’t even before free agency starts. This has already been busy. Yes, if teams blow the time allotment the pick is forfeited but I can’t recall it ever happening and I’m sure there’d be a 20-second warning issued to each team close to the deadline. Two teams — Phoenix and Philadelphia — lost their second-round picks as part of penalties for free agency misfeasance last summer. I fully expect Ja’Kobe Walter and Jonathan Mogbo to be with the Raptors for the entire season. Maybe a game or two in the G League but that’s about it. Jamal Shead and Ulrich Chomche will see some G League action, I bet. Q: A bit late, but I wanted to flag your insightful Insider piece about the complicated personnel decisions re: Pascal Siakam and OG Anunoby. I’m as guilty as anyone in ascribing this purely to finances, so thanks for the deeper perspective. With 5,000 other Victorians, I avoided the NBA draft thanks to the senior women’s national team and Portugal. With a 12-person Olympic roster, there are some excellent Canadian players who will not be going to Paris (perhaps a couple of remarkable teenagers will be deemed too youthful). It was fun to watch coach Victor Lapeña experiment with lineups and tactics (a power forward seemed to have a brief stint at point guard). Not in Victoria was someone who will assuredly be going, Bridget Carleton who, as they say, has “taken a leap” in her fifth professional season, best exemplified by her monster performance earlier this week in something called the Commissioner’s Cup. Perhaps she is more confident or her team is much better, or both, but she is having a terrific WNBA season. Dare I say that the patient rebuild of the Minnesota Lynx supplies as good a model as any for the Raptors in the next few years? James A., Victoria A: I didn’t see the game thanks to the NBA draft but I heard they looked good — Portugal’s not exactly a global power, though — and there was some experimenting going on. Makes sense, too, to find who can do what. The full team — 12 players and alternates — is being announced Tuesday. It will include the four WNBAers, I’m told and eight you saw in Victoria. Q: Hi Doug, No NBA games, no NBA news right? Ok, not entirely true! I’m sure there are lots of questions about all the new Raptors additions, so I won’t add to the pile, but I did want to ask a few other questions: 1) Last week you briefly mentioned that Dalano Banton, as a member of the Celtics team, for the majority of the season would be eligible for a championship ring. Does that mean some former Raptors in a similar situation have rings? (Delon Wright? CJ Miles? Anyone else?) Did Jonas Valanciunas’s injury mean he didn’t play enough games to qualify? 2) Read a great article echoing a point that you made about Zack Edey and many other drafted players; critics focus too much on the negatives and forget about the positive qualities of the player. As a result, like the 2013 draft, this one was labelled as “weak” because of no clear frontrunners. Rudy Gobert can’t play offence, Giannis Antetokounmpo is too raw, neither Jalen Brunson or Nikola Jokic are elite athletes etc ... Fair assessments, to a degree, but missed the big picture. Thoughts? 3) Do you have any idea how early NBA scouts start paying attention to players? Obviously NCAA, and prestigious high school tournaments ... but beyond that? (The odd news stories about seven-foot tall sixth graders etc?) Thanks for all the pre-draft articles! I love Summer League, one of the earliest indicators of how well teams really drafted! Bernie M A: Teams can decide what they want to do to honour or include in celebrations anyone on the roster at any point in the championship. The Raptors did not give rings to Valanciunas, Wright or Miles, which I understand is the norm. I admit I wasn’t sure Edey was an NBA player at the start of the season, seeing him at the combine live and talking to people with teams that worked him out, I became convinced he was. Teams start putting together dossiers on kids in the mid-teens through such things as the McDonald’s all-star game, the Nike world event and various big-ticket AAU tournaments. Q: Do you have a list of names that we will probably see playing in the Summer League games for the Raptors? You mentioned in this forum a couple of months ago that Grady Dick was a probable, still true? Paul M A: I’m typing this early Saturday morning before heading home from a wedding and haven’t got the full roster. I wouldn’t be surprised if we have it by the time you read this Sunday. I don’t know about Dick but my guess is he’d be in Vegas to workout with the group but not play in games. Q: Hi Doug, Do you know if the Raptors made an attempt to trade for Josh Giddey? He’s still so very young and I imagine he spends all summer working on his jump shot. (He better be working on his jump shot all summer long!) Richard F A: I am not 100 per cent sure but I be shocked if they even made a call. They were always going to pay Immanuel Quickley as the starter and Giddey would probably be an expensive backup. Plus, I’m in the category of not entirely sure about how good he is. Doug

Colin Kaepernick,"Eight years on, Colin Kaepernick waits for NFL call: 'I could help win a Championship'",https://www.skysports.com/nfl/news/12118/13195418/eight-years-on-colin-kaepernick-waits-for-nfl-call-i-could-help-win-a-championship,"

 Colin Kaepernick believes he could still help a side win a championship in the NFL; it has been eight years since he last played; he helped the San Francisco 49ers to their first Super Bowl since 1994 but has not competed since 2016 
          Reporting from Paris
       Monday 12 August 2024 19:13, UK Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  Former NFL quarterback Colin Kaepernick believes he could help a franchise win a championship if he played in the sport again, despite an eight-year absence. Kaepernick spent six years with the San Francisco 49ers, helping them to their first Super Bowl since 1994 during the 2012 season, but has not competed in the NFL since 2016. ""We're still training, still pushing,"" Kaepernick told Sky Sports News. ""So hopefully. We've just got to get one of these team owners to open up. ""It's something I've trained my whole life for, so to be able to step back on the field, I think that would be a major moment, a major accomplishment for me. I think I could bring a lot to a team and help them win a championship."" In August 2016 and during his final season with the San Francisco 49ers, Kaepernick began kneeling during the pre-game national anthem in the NFL to protest racial injustice and police brutality. 'Taking a knee' made headlines globally and still happens in sports all over the world, including before certain matches during the Premier League and WSL seasons. At the time, two days after pledging to donate $1m to community organisations, Kaepernick said: ""The message is that we have a lot of issues in this country that we need to deal with.

              How Kaepernick first started taking a knee
             ""We have a lot of people that are oppressed. We have a lot of people that aren't treated equally, that aren't given equal opportunities,"" Kaepernick said speaking at Nike's 'Art of Victory' exhibition in partnership with the Pompidou Centre at the Olympic Games. Kaepernick said he would continue to kneel ""until justice is served"". The protests spread across the NFL in September 2016, and during the first week of the season, 11 players from the west to east coast protested. Taking a knee also began happening in the NWSL, with World-Cup winning footballer Megan Rapinoe kneeling during a national anthem in September 2016 and saying ""we need to have a more thoughtful, two-sided conversation about racial issues in this country"". The then US-president, Barack Obama, also spoke about Kaepernick's actions, and said: ""He's exercising his constitutional right to make a statement. I think there are a lot of ways you can do it when it comes to the flag and national anthem."" The NFL reports that more than 20 million people are currently playing flag football across 100 countries, with the five-versus-five version of American football a non-contact sport that is played by people of all ages. The next Olympic Games take place in Los Angeles in 2028 and flag football is one of the sports set to be introduced for the first time, something Kaepernick would love to be a part of. ""Hopefully we'll be out there,"" he said. ""We're going to work out some things, see if we can make it in there. Would love to be out there."" At the Paris Olympics, Kaepernick watched USA fight back from a 13-point deficit against Serbia in the semi-finals of the men's basketball and said it was a ""phenomenal game to be able to be at"". The USA won their fifth consecutive Olympic gold medal in a thrilling game against hosts France on Saturday, who they beat 98-87, with Lebron James scoring 14 points as he won his fourth Olympic medal and third gold. Steph Curry led the way to the win, scoring 24, while Devin Booker and Kevin Durant - the first four-time men's gold medallist in Olympic basketball history - scored 15 each. ""Hopefully they [Team USA] continue to build on their legacy but we have some of the all-time greats on this team,"" he said. ""You have a lot of players who are more on the tail-end of their career, but also performing at levels that we just haven't seen players do at their ages. ""When you get to see competitors who compete against each other their whole career get to team up and actually play together, so to be able to see the dynamic of Lebron, Steph, KD [Kevin Durant], Joel [Embiid], Taytum, D Booker, they've got the full squad out there. ""They're all All-Stars and for me I think about how you even put a team together, like, these are the five that are at any given moment. I don't want to be the one making that decision because everybody's so talented."" Kaepernick was in Paris running the 10km in the Marathon for All in partnership with Nike, along with Olympic champions Caster Semenya and Mo Farah. The event allowed amateurs to tackle the Olympic marathon course the night between the men's and women's races.

Shannon Sharpe,Devin Booker’s Surprising Take on Noah Lyles Provokes ESPN’s Shannon Sharpe: “You Ain’t Winning”,https://www.essentiallysports.com/us-sports-news-olympics-news-track-and-field-news-nba-basketball-news-devin-bookers-surprising-take-on-noah-lyles-provokes-espns-shannon-sharpe-you-aint-winning/,"More Sports ES Fancast Aug 6, 2024 | 9:59 PM EDT via Imago Image Credits : Imago via Imago Image Credits : Imago Noah Lyles won 100m Olympic gold, crossing the finish line five thousandth of a second ahead of Kishane Thompson. His historic win reignited the argument between track and field and NBA fans. However, Tokyo 2020 basketball gold medalist, Devin Booker, also chimed in ahead of the USA vs. Brazil match. The Olympian said he “still doesn’t see eye to eye,” with Lyles on his “World champions of what?” comment about the NBA. “I feel like all the best talent in the world is in the NBA. And that’s coming from an Olympic gold medalist who believes that being an NBA champion was probably harder to do,” argued Booker. However, the 4x NBA all-star’s comments didn’t land with Shannon Sharpe. “Devin! It was a moot point. I was dead, we had put this to bead. Why are you digging it up?” the nearly livid 56-year-old asked. Sharpe also disagreed with the Phoenix Suns player. “It is not harder,” countered Sharpe. “You know why? Because you can play (basketball), you cannot run,” with a leg injury implied Sharpe. “If anything below your waist bothers you. You ain’t winning,” in track and field events, said Shannon Sharpe in the latest episode of Nightcap on YouTube. ADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad ADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad Poll 1 of 4  Do you agree with Devin Booker's surprising take on Noah Lyles? Absolutely Not at all Somewhat I need more context What excites you the most about Pallas Kunaiyi-Akpanah's journey to the Paris Olympics? Her Nigerian roots Her college basketball career Her WNBA experience Her potential impact on the Olympics Do you think Carl Lewis' comments about the Paris Olympics are justified? Absolutely Not at all Somewhat No opinion Do you think Nike's move to use Deion Sanders to reconcile with Kevin Durant was genuine? Yes, it's a smart PR move No, it's just damage control Maybe, time will tell Who cares, it's all about the money However, the retired NFL tight end also had a solid argument while defining Noah Lyles and track and field. The ESPN analyst argued everyone how people have seen basket ballers “tape things up,” like injured toes, (feet) arches, and Achilles, and play to win. Sharpe also named players such as Rajon Rondo, who continued to pay with a dislocated elbow. In fact, the former footballer didn’t even shy away from giving examples from his own sport. “We saw The Rams’ Jack Youngblood, play with a broken leg,” said Sharpe. Finally, after sufficiently substantiating his argument, Sharpe asked Devin Booker which track and field event the NBA star believed could be played with a broken leg. However, Shannon Sharpe and Devin Booker aren’t the only ones talking about what Noah Lyles said last year. ADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad “World Champion of what? The United States?” is all it took for the 27-year-old track icon to spark a debate that refuses to die down. However, the real reason behind the debate catching a second wind is because of Lyles’ historic 100m Olympic medal. Immediately after Lyles backed up his tall claims, social media filled with comments like “Noah Lyles just murdered all of NBA Twitter.” Now, the athletes and experts are once again going back and forth on every platform. DeMarcus Cousins echoed the words of Devin Booker in the August 6th episode of the Above The Rim with DH 12 podcast. The Rio 2016 basketball champion also argued that the NBA winners deserved the World Champion title, as those teams often consist of the best players from across the world. However, with Lyles eyeing another gold medal in the 200m sprint, it seems this debate won’t be ending anytime soon.

Johnny Manziel,Johnny Manziel Playfully Crowns Michael Vick as the GOAT Quarterback Trumping Tom Brady and Patrick Mahomes,https://www.essentiallysports.com/nfl-legends-news-johnny-manziel-names-michael-vick-as-the-goat-quarterback-trumping-tom-brady-and-patrick-mahomes/,"More Sports ES Fancast Mar 21, 2024 | 8:05 AM EDT via Imago Credits: Imago via Imago Credits: Imago 2012 Heisman Trophy winner Johnny Manziel showcased his funny bone by dropping a bizarre opinion on the NFL GOAT debate. Manziel recently appeared on the ‘Run It Back‘ on FanDuel TV LIVE with co-hosts Michelle Beadle, Shams Charania, Lou Williams, and Chandler Parsons. When asked who he thinks the GOAT is, Manziel’s answer left everyone stunned. Instead of picking from popular choices like Tom Brady and Patrick Mahomes, he name-dropped former Atalanta Falcons legend Micheal Vick. Vick was a Heisman Trophy winner like Manziel in 1999 and was considered a dual-threat quarterback. During the interview, Manziel jokingly backed his belief that Micheal Vick, known for his electrifying playing style and unparalleled athleticism, deserves the title of the GOAT title. “I love Michael Vick,” Manziel stated emphatically. “I’ve been a Vick guy my whole life. What he did on the field was just different. His running style, his playmaking ability – it changed the game.” ADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad However, he later repealed his choice, and supported Tom Brady’s bid on the title, emphasizing, “Mahomes is the guy right now; everybody’s got to knock him off,” Manziel explained. “But how can you not love Vick? He’s a game-changer. You have to win six, seven Super Bowls to beat Brady. Vick changed the game.” Some fans argued in the comments that Vick’s career remained unfulfilled due to the lack of silverware. It sustained success, much like that of Brady and Mahomes. However, despite not being serious with his answers, Manziel’s take does offer a new perspective into how the best should be considered.

He underlined how Vick helped change how the position is looked at and formulated into a modern-day quarterback. “Vick is blazing his path,” Manziel defended, “His thousand-yard receiving seasons, only Randy Moss comes close. He’s a first-ballot Hall of Famer.” Known by his fans by the moniker “Ookie“, Vick was the first quarterback to rush for 1,000 yards in a single season, showcasing his unique skill set. He was selected for four Pro Bowls and won the NFL Comeback Player of the Year award in 2010.

The warning signs led shares to close 20% lower on Friday -- making it the worst trading day in the company's history since its IPO in Dec. 1980. The plunge wiped about $28 billion off of Nike's market cap, bringing it to just under $114 billion from $142 billion a day earlier.  As Wall Street digested the dismal outlook from the world's largest sportswear company, at least six investment banks downgraded Nike's stock. Analysts at Morgan Stanley and Stifel took it a step further, specifically calling the company's management into question. ""The FY25 guide (the 5th downward consensus revision in 6 quarters), pushes prospects for growth inflection further into 2025 (perhaps FY4Q or spring '25 at the earliest) asking investors to both underwrite success of not yet proven styles and look across an uncertain consumer discretionary backdrop into 2HCY24 until momentum could build again into 2HCY25,"" wrote Stifel analyst Jim Duffy. ""Management credibility is severely challenged and potential for C-level regime change adds further uncertainty."" Since Donahoe took over as Nike's top executive, its stock is down more than 25% as of Friday's close, significantly underperforming both the S&P 500 and the XRT – the retail-focused ETF – which saw gains of around 67% and 66% in that time period, respectively. Nike finance chief Matt Friend on Thursday attributed the guidance cut to a host of factors. Some, like softness in China and challenging foreign exchange headwinds, are outside of Nike's control, but others are problems it squarely created under Donahoe's leadership.  The company is expecting wholesale orders to be slow as it scales new styles, pulls back on classic franchises and works to repair its relationships with key retail partners after spending the last few years cutting them off in favor of a direct-selling strategy.  At the same time, loyal customers who shop on Nike's website are no longer springing for new pairs of Air Force 1s, Air Jordan 1s or Dunks, the company's core franchises. Critics say the sneaker lines have dominated the retailer's offerings for too long and turned customers away as they sought fresh styles and innovative designs from a slew of upstart competitors.  That's left Nike to win back some of its most essential customers – runners. As the retailer focused on its direct-selling strategy at the expense of innovation, scrappy competitors like On Running and Hoka snatched up market share. ""It was almost silly towards the end of the call they talked about running being such a key sport that consumers are taking part in. … We've known that for a long time, we've known that the consumer changed their mind post-pandemic, how they're much more active,"" Jessica Ramírez, senior research analyst at Jane Hali & Associates, told CNBC, adding a management change at Nike is ""quite needed.""  ""Post-lockdown, we saw that the consumer did adopt running and was serious about that and there was an everyday runner, and Nike didn't really respond to that,"" she said. ""I think when you have management missing key consumer shifts, there's a problem with your company … something changed and they've missed the mark."" Kevin McCarthy, a senior research analyst at Neuberger Berman, told CNBC's Scott Wapner on Thursday that the company needs a change in management and speculated that Donahoe's employment contract could soon expire.  ""Everything that you've suggested is wrong with this company seems to flow back to execution, management and everything else,"" McCarthy said on CNBC's ""Closing Bell."" ""They've got a couple internal candidates right now that are very capable … you've got a couple ex-Nike candidates, too, that have been in the discussion, and then you also have other competitors that have been discussed. But I do think that it's assumed that the leadership of this company will be changing over the next six months.""  In fairness to Donahoe, the Covid-19 pandemic started in earnest in the U.S. less than two months into his tenure, and he's had to grapple with shuttered stores, remote workers and a roller-coaster ride of shifting consumer preferences and abilities.  While the company's stock may be down, Nike's annual sales have grown some 37% under his leadership from $37.4 billion in fiscal 2020 to $51.36 billion in fiscal 2024.  If you ask Phil Knight, Nike's founder and its chairman emeritus, Donahoe is doing just fine.  ""I have seen Nike's plans for the future and wholeheartedly believe in them,"" the 86-year-old told CNBC in a statement. ""I am optimistic in Nike's future and John Donahoe has my unwavering confidence and full support."" Got a confidential news tip? We want to hear from you.

You’ve reached your account maximum for followed topics.                         
                    Unsurprisingly, the Los Angeles Lakers' search for a new head coach has been nothing short of captivating. 
    

    
                                JJ Redick
                    
                     leads a pool of candidates who could take the kingdom's keys.
    

    
                                 As the process of hiring a new head coach progresses, a recent report has shed light on what the future coaching staff could ultimately look like.
                         According to Dan Woike of the Los Angeles Times, the Lakers met with James Borrego on Wednesday and were pleased with the interview.
                         “Latest on the Lakers coaching search, Borrego interviewing (heard he was impressive) and possible assistant coach names that people have been talking about, some more likely than others.""
                          Although Los Angeles is interviewing other candidates, it sounds like the head coaching job is Redick’s to lose at this point. With Redick still bound to ESPN through the duration of the 2024 NBA Playoffs, the hiring likely won’t happen until the Finals have concluded.
                         However, it appears that the Lakers have begun to think about potential additions to the coaching staff that include names like Scott Brooks and 2x NBA champion Rajon Rondo.
                         Via Los Angeles Times:
                         “Rumors of the Lakers’ staffing plans have run throughout the league during the past two weeks, with some names most commonly mentioned including former head coach Scott Brooks and assistants Sam Cassell and Jared Dudley, Woike wrote.” Ex-Lakers guard Rajon Rondo has also been under consideration, according to people with knowledge of the situation not authorized to speak publicly.”
                         Rondo began his career with the Boston Celtics in 2006. In the following season, he became a full-time starter as the Celtics defeated the Lakers in six games that June to win the world championship. In 2018, he signed with the Lakers, and in his second season with the team, he played a key role off the bench as it won it all.
      
                     For years, Rondo has been lauded by his peers for his high basketball IQ and strong feel for the game. Perhaps he could even make a decent head coach someday after he pays his dues as an assistant first.
      It’s been widely reported James will not be involved in the Lakers’ coaching probe. Given James’ history, that statement naturally draws skepticism.
                         In April, Rondo called it quits after 16 seasons in the NBA. The 6'1"" guard’s ability to push the pace, facilitate, attack the basket, and make timely plays was indispensable to L.A.’s 2020 championship squad. James certainly appreciated playing with him.
                         James spoke glowingly of his former teammate:
                         “One of the best players I ever played with. Obviously, his IQ was out of this world. I was very lucky to get to team up with him… ‘Do always talked about if he ever teamed up with me, he knew we could win a championship. And we did that."" - LeBron James
                         James would undoubtedly vouch for Rondo to join the Lakers coaching staff. No. 23 has often stated his affinity towards guys with a high basketball IQ. According to James, Rondo is one of the most brilliant basketball minds ever.
                         Without a doubt, the job of coaching James — as either the head coach or assistant – is extraordinarily challenging. Without a doubt, James' passive-aggressive nature can make a coach's job much harder than it needs to be. Without a doubt, James has some blood on his hands for the way Darvin Ham’s tenure went down.
                         For some, that will be enough to brand James with that ""coach killer"" moniker -- one of the most brutal insults you can give a professional athlete.
                         In light of this recent criticism, James perhaps decided he’d stay out of it altogether. However, it wouldn’t be a stunner if James spoke privately to Rondo about signing on to coach.
     Rich Paul, the agent of LeBron James, appeared to accidentally hint at James' future with the Lakers.

Credit: Kyle Terada-USA TODAY Sports Is Jaylen Brown's controversy a sign of deeper issues within the team? USA basketball’s managing director, Grant Hill, has been caught in a wave of controversies since the Olympics began. It started with Jaylen Brown‘s exclusion from the squad, and then Jayson Tatum not receiving enough playing time during the Olympic games. Even though Hill said that he would consider Brown in the 2028 Olympic squad, things have not cooled down yet. Team USA went to the Olympics with a star-studded lineup, which comprised 12 players top-tier NBA players. Yes, they won the gold, but it was not all sunshine and rainbows behind the scenes. With that much talent, not everyone got the minutes they wanted – even the big names from the NBA squads. Just look at Jayson Tatum-he ended up with multiple DNPs, as he sat out two whole games with no playing time and not everyone was happy with it. In light of that, veteran NBA analyst Brian Windhorst advised Grant Hill to pick the young players going ahead, to avoid all the drama. The idea is to start developing the young players specifically for FIBA competitions and to build a squad that is down to stick together through a few summers, leading up to big events like the 2028 Olympics. “I don’t necessarily think it’s the worst idea in the world to take all young guys to the World Cup. Like, do what they do in soccer of the Olympics and say, we are gonna take all 23 and under,” Windhorst mentioned on the ESPN podcast. ADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad “Because we[Team USA] are gonna start developing FIBA players. We are gonna say, ‘hey, commit to playing in the summer in 2026, commit to playing the summer in 27′ and you are not promised for 28’ but let’s see where it leads. Maybe there shouldn’t be, in spots 11 and 12, maybe there shouldn’t be star players there. Maybe there should be FIBA players, NBA players, don’t get me wrong, but FIBA players who have played for multiple summers in a row,” the media vet further added. Is Jaylen Brown's controversy a ticking time bomb for Team USA? React! Reactions Windhorst wants Team USA to create a crew that’s more in sync with international play. After all, it’s all about long-term growth and commitment, not just banking on NBA stars. Talking about NBA stars though, what’s been brewing between Grant Hill and Jaylen Brown? Let’s dive deep. It was not that long ago that Jaylen Brown took a shot at Team USA and Nike, letting everyone know he was not cool with Team USA picking his Celtics teammate, Derrick White, as Kawhi Leonard‘s replacement instead of him. The current finals MVP tweeted, “@nike this what we doing.” Brown was probably implying it was Nike that kept him off the Team USA roster. ADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad In response, Hill said, “And, so, whatever theories that might be out there, they’re just that. But that’s my responsibility. And it’s tough. It’s tough to have conversations, tell people that they’re not on the team.” Jaylen Brown did not take too kindly to being called a conspiracy theorist by the USAB managing director, as he shot back, stating, “Grant Hill calling me a conspiracy theorist is disappointing. I’ve been a VP [of the NBPA] since I was 21 years old, I have a great understanding.” However, Grant Hill now wants to squash the beef. He is even open to having Brown on the Team USA squad in the 2028 Olympics. “It’s a lot of noise. I’m confident he and I will sit down at some point and talk about it and get to some level of understanding. He’ll be a candidate, if he wants, in 2028. One thing I’ve learned, you can’t take anything personally in this role. I haven’t personalized anything. My objective, my goal, is to win. And as soon as, hopefully, that happens, we pivot and start looking ahead to the future,” Hill said. As this might have been the last season for many of the veteran players in the Olympics, there will probably be space for Jaylen Brown on the Team USA roster for the 2028 Olympics. But the question is, after all that has happened, will Brown accept the offer to be a part of Team USA? What are your thoughts?

Jayson Tatum,"Will Jayson Tatum Lead the Charge in 2028 Olympics? Steve Kerr Decision Could Make Team USA a Boston Celtics Powerhouse, Here's How",https://www.essentiallysports.com/nba-active-basketball-news-will-jayson-tatum-lead-the-charge-in-two-thousand-twenty-eight-olympics-steve-kerr-decision-could-make-team-usa-a-boston-celtics-powerhouse-here-s-how/,"More Sports ES Fancast Aug 11, 2024 | 7:57 PM EDT Can Jayson Tatum turn Team USA into a Celtics-dominated powerhouse in the 2028 Olympics? The announcement of the 2024 Olympics roster drew criticism from many. With the kind of talent available in the NBA and the no. of players willing to play, disagreements were more than bound to happen. But soon, another controversy pretty much rocked the Olympic boat. Steve Kerr, deciding not to play Jayson Tatum in the tournament opener, really ruffled serious feathers. But then again, taking a look at the whole Team USA campaign, Kerr has been at the receiving end of the short stick for his player combinations. Come 2028, when the next round of the Olympics rolls up, it seems like the USA Basketball board could very well turn into a Celtics powerhouse. For one, choosing Derrick White, over 2024 Finals MVP Jaylen Brown, after Kawhi Leonard withdrew his candidature, had put Managing Director Grant Hill in the spotlight—and not the good kind. At the time, Hill calmed the crowd with a promise. If Brown was willing, he’d have a place in the 2028 Olympic roster. And for all the Tatum fans, this new Evan Sidery update on X would also prove to be quite a relief. “Steve Kerr is likely to retire as Team USA head coach, which means a new lead voice for 2028 in Los Angeles. Erik Spoelstra is viewed as the strong internal favorite to become Team USA’s next in line following Gregg Popovich and Kerr.” ADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad Along with Kerr, LeBron James, Kevin Durant, and Stephen Curry – the three-headed hydra of Team USA- are also likely to be retiring. While it’s true that it’s a tough position to fill, it’s still vacant. And by 2028, there’s no doubt that JT, JB, and White would very well adorn the veteran badge. And if the 30-year-old is still a Celtic, Team USA would, in effect, be a ‘Celtics powerhouse’. Poll 1 of 4  Do you think Jayson Tatum can lead Team USA to Olympic gold in 2028?

And they went public with their criticism. The head coach, however, has played it diplomatic across the board and he delivered on the promise of bringing the Gold medal back home. Even though the critics couldn’t say much after that, as even Jayson was seen sharing a broad smile with his teammates, let’s dive deeper and see what his mother and franchise owner had to say earlier. It was only a matter of time before Brandy Cole would be forced to put her foot down. Her son just led his team to an NBA title in the wake of the best record in the league. He earned a spot on the All-NBA first team for 3 years straight and received All-Star recognition for 5 years! So yes, Mama Tatum was indignant. And she made sure to let Kerr know of it when she replied to a tweet from ESPN’s Dick Vitale. “Someone pls let me know is @jaytatum0 injured as he hasn’t received the PT ( playing time ) u would expect an All NBA player to get,” Vitale posted from his X account. Cole immediately took the chance to re-tweet with a dig of her own. “No he not. But if you find out what’s going on please let me know – unacceptable and makes NO SENSE.” If Kerr thought JT’s mom was the only one who had some words for him, think again. ADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad Kerr’s actions also stupefied Boston’s majority owner, Grousbeck. Appearing on the Greg Hill Show, recently, he said, “I mean, I wouldn’t play Steve Kerr. Let me put it that way… It’s a complete mystery. I think Jayson doesn’t deserve anything but praise, kudos and playing time. I think he and Jaylen [Brown] led us to this unbelievable championship and they’re not apparently helping the Olympic team. It’s mystifying.” Clearly, there are a lot of people who are unhappy with Steve Kerr. But even amid such disappointing circumstances, Jayson Tatum has his fill of happiness. The NBA championship, obviously. But the Tatum family welcomed another member. After the Team USA win, the 2x Olympian and his family posed for family portraits, and who else to join them, but Grammy winning-singer and Tatum’s baby mama, Ella Mai? Anyway, the 2028 Team USA roster is going to be very interesting. If not for anything else, to see if Grant Hill makes good on his word. What do you think?

Devin Booker,Devin Booker’s Surprising Take on Noah Lyles Provokes ESPN’s Shannon Sharpe: “You Ain’t Winning”,https://www.essentiallysports.com/us-sports-news-olympics-news-track-and-field-news-nba-basketball-news-devin-bookers-surprising-take-on-noah-lyles-provokes-espns-shannon-sharpe-you-aint-winning/,"More Sports ES Fancast Aug 6, 2024 | 9:59 PM EDT via Imago Image Credits : Imago via Imago Image Credits : Imago Noah Lyles won 100m Olympic gold, crossing the finish line five thousandth of a second ahead of Kishane Thompson. His historic win reignited the argument between track and field and NBA fans. However, Tokyo 2020 basketball gold medalist, Devin Booker, also chimed in ahead of the USA vs. Brazil match. The Olympian said he “still doesn’t see eye to eye,” with Lyles on his “World champions of what?” comment about the NBA. “I feel like all the best talent in the world is in the NBA. And that’s coming from an Olympic gold medalist who believes that being an NBA champion was probably harder to do,” argued Booker. However, the 4x NBA all-star’s comments didn’t land with Shannon Sharpe. “Devin! It was a moot point. I was dead, we had put this to bead. Why are you digging it up?” the nearly livid 56-year-old asked. Sharpe also disagreed with the Phoenix Suns player. “It is not harder,” countered Sharpe. “You know why? Because you can play (basketball), you cannot run,” with a leg injury implied Sharpe. “If anything below your waist bothers you. You ain’t winning,” in track and field events, said Shannon Sharpe in the latest episode of Nightcap on YouTube.

Yes, it's a smart PR move No, it's just damage control Maybe, time will tell Who cares, it's all about the money However, the retired NFL tight end also had a solid argument while defining Noah Lyles and track and field. The ESPN analyst argued everyone how people have seen basket ballers “tape things up,” like injured toes, (feet) arches, and Achilles, and play to win. Sharpe also named players such as Rajon Rondo, who continued to pay with a dislocated elbow. In fact, the former footballer didn’t even shy away from giving examples from his own sport. “We saw The Rams’ Jack Youngblood, play with a broken leg,” said Sharpe. Finally, after sufficiently substantiating his argument, Sharpe asked Devin Booker which track and field event the NBA star believed could be played with a broken leg. However, Shannon Sharpe and Devin Booker aren’t the only ones talking about what Noah Lyles said last year. ADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad “World Champion of what? The United States?” is all it took for the 27-year-old track icon to spark a debate that refuses to die down. However, the real reason behind the debate catching a second wind is because of Lyles’ historic 100m Olympic medal. Immediately after Lyles backed up his tall claims, social media filled with comments like “Noah Lyles just murdered all of NBA Twitter.” Now, the athletes and experts are once again going back and forth on every platform. DeMarcus Cousins echoed the words of Devin Booker in the August 6th episode of the Above The Rim with DH 12 podcast. The Rio 2016 basketball champion also argued that the NBA winners deserved the World Champion title, as those teams often consist of the best players from across the world. However, with Lyles eyeing another gold medal in the 200m sprint, it seems this debate won’t be ending anytime soon.

Allen Iverson,"Caitlin Clark Nike Deal: Only LeBron James, Allen Iverson, and 5 Other NBA Rookies Struck a Bigger Deal Than 22YO Sensation",https://www.essentiallysports.com/nba-active-basketball-news-caitlin-clark-nike-deal-only-seven-nba-players-including-lebron-james-allen-iverson-struck-a-bigger-rookie-deal-than-sensation/,"More Sports ES Fancast Apr 21, 2024 | 10:22 PM EDT via Imago Image Credits: Imago via Imago Image Credits: Imago It took Stephen Curry a few years to change basketball for good, and for it, he needed Klay Thompson and a well-oiled machine, that is the Warriors. Caitlin Clark is changing the landscape of women’s basketball like no one before her. But unlike Steph, the 22-year-old is not bringing a revolution in how the game is played. WNBA’s latest #1 pick is rather redefining the financial heights for a female basketball player. Sports apparel juggernauts Nike, with a reported 8-year $28 million deal, as per WSJ, made Clark the biggest endorsement holder in women’s basketball. To put that in perspective, LeBron James, the face of the NBA struck a $90 million deal in 2003. The same year, Serena Williams took home $40 million, paving the way for female athletes around the globe. It took a basketball player 21 years to reach anywhere near that number and Clark still fell double-digit short of those numbers. But it is still a historic win for women’s basketball. How, you ask? Let’s deep dive right into it. Only 7 NBA players have signed a bigger rookie shoe endorsement deal than Caitlin Clark. ADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad Caitlin Clark overtook John Wall’s $25 million deal with Reebok to beat him and all NBA rookies in the game’s history with her latest incentive with Nike, which will get her over $3 million/year. That raises a question, how much will the ex-Iowa star make in WNBA? ADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad This is where the disparity still makes the NBA a different ball game altogether. Clark will make a mere $76,535 in her rookie year as a #1 pick in the WNBA. In an overall 4-year deal worth $338k, Spotrac claimed that her salary will increase year by year and she will take home $97,582 in the fourth year. Soon after she was drafted, the WNBA’s Commissioner, Cathy Engelbert revealed, “Caitlin has the ability to make up to a half of a million dollars just in WNBA wages this year, so they’re just looking at a base, which is collectively bargained and [what is reported is] actually is low, because she’s the No. 1 pick.” ADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad On the other hand in NBA, Victor Wembanyama and several other rookies before him made more than $10 million in their 1st year. Notably, the WNBA current players receive a revised salary after 2020 which is set under the current union collective bargaining agreement. However, there is a lot of catching up to do. But with Caitlin’s global recognition, good paydays are not too far for female athletes. And the WNBA already got a glimpse of her stardom after the former Hawkeye star reportedly pulled in 3.09 million viewers during her draft!

Patrice Evra,Manchester United squad were ‘ready to kill’ team-mate after Liverpool loss,https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/i-hope-you-broke-your-29098020,"Patrice Evra has recalled the Manchester United dressing room’s furious reaction after Nani was stretchered off in a 3-1 defeat against Liverpool Patrice Evra has revealed the Manchester United dressing room’s furious reaction after Nani cried during a defeat to Liverpool in 2011. Dirk Kuyt scored a hat-trick at Anfield as the Reds ran out 3-1 winners, but the game is also still remembered for one horror tackle from Liverpool legend Jamie Carragher on Nani. The winger had already gifted the Reds their second goal of the afternoon, inexplicably heading Luis Suarez’s cross back into his own six-yard box for a grateful Kuyt to head home. But his game came to a premature end after he was stretchered off following Carragher’s challenge on the stroke of half-time.

More info The Liverpool defender surprisingly avoided a red card from referee Phil Dowd, with both sets of players angrily confronting each other in the aftermath of the incident. However, that came to an end after it was spotted that Nani was crying on the floor. And reflecting on the incident, Evra has admitted the United squad ""were ready to kill"" the Portuguese, revealing how he ended up being given a week off training following an angry confrontation with United manager Sir Alex Ferguson. “I remember when Nani had a crazy challenge against Jamie Carragher against Liverpool,” Evra recalled on BBC Radio 5 Live. “And we start coming and fighting with the player. “And I remember Paul Scholes saw Nani crying because you could see the bone. And when we saw that, we just said like, ‘come on guys!’ And we left. “I remember Ferguson at half-time when Nani was at the massage table and Ferguson came and he said, ‘I really hope you really broke your leg because crying at Anfield, this is impossible’. So this is to tell you the mentality. “We were waiting for Nani the next day and Ferguson had to give him one week off. He said, ‘I’ve given him one week off because mentally he is not ready to come back.’ But we were ready to kill him.”"

13, 2016 in Los Angeles, California. (Photo by Kevin Mazur/Getty Images) Can the new 'Inside the NBA' ever match the chemistry of Shaq, Barkley, and Reggie Miller? “I played 18 years professionally for the Pacers and right now this past year was my 18th year at Turner. So for 36 years, I’ve only known two things, yeah the Pacers and TNT and Turner.” NBA star turned-analyst Reggie Miller was very emotional last month about his future. The NBA was a step away from finalizing the new media rights set up of 11 years worth $76 billion with ESPN, Amazon, and NBC and Miller was sad about Inside the NBA not continuing further. But just when we thought TNT was out of the race, reports emerged this week that the network would use its matching rights to retain the NBA media rights. So, the Pacers legend was the happiest when he heard the news. On his Instagram, he wrote, “Well we have a pulse!! Now where it goes from here is above my pay grade, all I know is I’m excited to start my 20th season in the Fall with these dudes,” completing the statement with #LuckyAndBlessed. Miller uploaded a carousel of photos from the sets of Inside the NBA, featuring Charles Barkley, Shaquille O’Neal, Kenny Smith, and Ernie Johnson. He also shared BTS photos of his kids hanging around Barkley and Shaq. Wednesday was the deadline for TNT to submit the bid, and didn’t they leave it for the final day? ADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad As per reports, TNT Sports declared it will be matching one of its competitor’s deals to pay $1.8 to 2.2 billion annually to the league – a steep increase from the previous $1.2 billion. Although no name was mentioned, many reports have suggested TNT has matched tech giant Amazon’s C package. Poll 1 of 4  Do you think Reggie Miller's loyalty to Shaq and Barkley is justified?

At the time, he felt it was too quiet with no updates from their executives and hoped that the show continued. And he was not the only one who wanted the show to continue. Biggest names in entertainment and sports like Michael Ealy, Kenan Thompson, Quavo, Giannis Antetokounmpo, Mark Cuban, Steph Curry, and Magic Johnson joined the #KeepNBAonTNT campaign. The stars shared their stories on the docuseries about Inside the NBA. Although he was not a part of the docuseries, Miller also had a story to tell about his co-workers. ADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad Miller reckons what makes Inside the NBA a great show is the fact that it is unscripted, only Ernie Johnson has to lead the show in a direction. “But Shaq, Charles, Kenny what I mean he’s (Johnson) just throwing lobs and they’re finishing them.” Further, Reggie Miller said that the show provides honest feedback to the fans and players. That’s probably the reason for the high ratings of the show. During the NBA playoffs in May, TNT’s May 12 Game 4 coverage of the series drew 5.6 million viewers, whereas ESPN’s May 10 Game 3 coverage drew 5.2 million watchers, as per Nielsen. Meanwhile, none of the Inside the NBA guys have commented on the news of TNT using its matching rights. Maybe they are waiting for the final decision from the league. There have been reports that even if Warner Bros. Discovery intends to match the offer, there’s a chance Adam Silver, the commissioner of the NBA, might reject the offer. We will get a clearer picture in the upcoming weeks.

Chicago Bulls forward DeMar DeRozan, center, interrupts a postgame interview with guard Coby White on Feb. 6, 2024, at the United Center. (Vincent Alban/Chicago Tribune)When DeRozan arrived in Chicago three summers ago, I admittedly was not overwhelmed. He hadn’t made an All-Star team since 2017-18, and it seemed as though his best years were in the past. He basically disappeared in San Antonio following a stellar career in Toronto.But DeRozan soon proved he was far from finished, leading the Bulls to the top of the Eastern Conference at the outset of his first season. They had a 27-11 record and were atop the East on Jan. 11, 2022, and DeRozan had come up big so often that he earned his “King of the Fourth” moniker.But the Bulls’ season fell apart with the loss of Lonzo Ball two games later, and they never recovered. Karnišovas didn’t get DeRozan or LaVine any scoring help the next two offseasons, and both seasons resulted in losses in the play-in round.So the DeRozan era ended with a thud — only one playoff appearance, the 4-1 first-round loss to the Milwaukee Bucks in ’22.None of this was his fault, mind you. DeRozan continued to defy age and played almost every game in the era of load management, where veterans tend to sit out the second game of back-to-backs every opportunity they get.How many times does a 34-year-old lead the league in total minutes or minutes per game, as DeRozan did last year? I’ll hang up and listen for the answer.Love and losses: How DeMar DeRozan defined the Chicago Bulls during his 3-year tenureDeRozan said all along he loved Chicago and wanted to return, but assuredly he knew the Bulls weren’t interested, especially after the Caruso deal before the draft. DeRozan turns 35 next month, so perhaps it made perfect basketball sense for Karnišovas not to bring him back. The three-year, $74 million deal with the Kings carries some risks at his age.But DeRozan will now be a part of a new Big Three in Sacramento with De’Aaron Fox and Domantas Sabonis, and will have a better chance at finally winning a ring than he would’ve had in Chicago.Whether he can help make the Kings into a true contender in the West is debatable with the emergence of the young guns in Minnesota and Oklahoma City and a Denver team that now has something to prove after being knocked out of the playoffs by the Timberwolves in a Game 7 loss on their home court.Either way, Sacramento fans are already excited about the acquisition. DeRozan received a big ovation when he and Kings owner Vivek Ranadivé walked through the tunnel together at the Golden 1 Center on Saturday for the Kings’ California Summer League game. It was a king’s welcome if there ever was one.It was heartening to see, and a reminder of how much DeRozan was loved and respected in Chicago. He wasn’t just another basketball player for the Bulls, but the heartbeat of the franchise, one of the best teammates you could ask for and always available and accountable to the media no matter how tough a loss.Ayo Dosunmu, Coby White and Patrick Williams all owe him a debt of gratitude for teaching them how to be professionals. Hopefully, those lessons will endure.The Bulls might be able to replace his scoring, but it’s a stretch to believe they can replace DeRozan’s presence in the locker room. Maybe that doesn’t matter to Karnišovas if they keep getting younger and don’t intend on contending for a few years. But it should.Related Articles

			Trending:		 When DeMar DeRozan talked about the Chicago Bulls, he often talked about love.It wasn’t always outright. But beneath the jokes, the analysis and even the frustration, that affection was the most consistent undercurrent of DeRozan’s conversations. The trust he built with his teammates. The refusal to let a few hard weeks — or months, or years — shake his belief that he could make something happen here.Even as re-signing conversations stalled out in the final stretch of last season, DeRozan joked that negotiating with the team was like reasoning with a spouse after a fight: “What do we need to do to work on this, baby? Let’s figure this thing out. You want me. I want you.”The love never fully ran out. That was clear on the court, where DeRozan was always undeniably, recklessly invested. He played hurt. He played tired. Hell, he probably played too much. Last season, DeRozan led the NBA in playing time at the age of 34. In his three-year stint in Chicago, he played more than 90% of possible games.It wasn’t enough. Of course not. No amount of buzzer-beater heaves and 30-point games could outweigh the dysfunction and disrepair of the Bulls’ roster construction the past three years. But for three years, DeRozan lifted the Bulls to be more than they were meant to be.In Chicago, DeRozan got back to being himself.He had already rebuilt his game in San Antonio, but it took signing in Chicago to truly re-establish himself in the NBA. Over three seasons, DeRozan averaged 25.5 points while shooting 49.6% from the field. In the process, he earned back-to-back All-Star selections, notched 12 games with 40 or more points and cemented his moniker of “King in the Fourth” as a two-time Clutch Player of the Year runner-up.There was a moment when it seemed like all of this was going to work out here.

DeRozan’s first winter in Chicago was filled with hope. Despite all the offseason criticism, DeRozan was clicking alongside Zach LaVine, Lonzo Ball and Nikola Vučević. And there was nothing DeRozan loved more than proving doubters wrong.And then 2022 came. On Dec. 31, 2021, DeRozan launched off one leg as the clock ran down in Indianapolis, slinging a 3-pointer to close the year with a win over the Pacers. The next night, DeRozan repeated the feat, tossing in his signature pump fake before landing a dagger three from the corner in Washington D.C. to beat the Wizards.No player had ever made buzzer-beater game-winners from behind the arc on consecutive nights. It was another slice of history for DeRozan, another highlight that belied the weaknesses that would soon send the Bulls tumbling from their stature atop the Eastern Conference.The impossibility of that shot in Indiana — one leg up, the shot clock forgotten — captured everything that worked about DeRozan with the Bulls.

These are the traces that DeRozan will leave on this young roster. The confidence he imbued into White as a leader. The persistence he honed for rookies like Dalen Terry. On the court, DeRozan was best known for his deadly midrange jumpers and fourth-quarter heroism. But within the locker room, DeRozan made a name for himself with his Bulls teammates by just showing up.He drove hours to Champaign to see Ayo Dosunmu’s jersey retired by Illinois in the guard’s rookie year. He invited – or more accurately, compelled – every player under 23 to spend summers in Los Angeles training with him. When asked about those workouts the following preseason, DeRozan only grinned, relishing memories of putting the kids through hell.“The word ‘leadership’ is thrown around so much in the NBA,” Vučević told the Tribune after DeRozan’s All-Star selection in 2023. “It’s not something you can decide to be. You have to have it within yourself. DeMar has earned our respect — with the way he’s played, with his achievements, the way he comports himself on the court, off the court. He really took the time to make sure he knew everybody and established himself as somebody we could trust.”Three days into 2022, DeRozan couldn’t go home.It was an off night. The Bulls had beaten the Orlando Magic. DeRozan dropped 29 points, but he also went 7-for-13 from the free-throw line. Any hint of inaccuracy from the penalty stripe for DeRozan — a now-career 84.1% free throw shooter — was a sign of weakness he didn’t care to repeat.So he stayed. United Center workers began to strip the opposing stanchion, break down the sideline seating and peel up the court to reveal the ice concealed under the hardwood for an upcoming Blackhawks game. And DeRozan stayed until he made 250 shots from the stripe. Until he made things right.DeRozan never had the chance to make things right in Chicago. His departure to the Sacramento Kings reflected a harsher truth: there probably never was a chance. The Bulls were too broken, the roster too flawed. It was never going to work out.But the love was there. That was never in doubt. And as the Bulls take their next steps, the impact of DeRozan’s devotion to his team will remain — on the court and in the locker room, and within this young generation he shaped. It wasn’t always outright. But beneath the jokes, the analysis and even the frustration, that affection was the most consistent undercurrent of DeRozan’s conversations. The trust he built with his teammates. The refusal to let a few hard weeks — or months, or years — shake his belief that he could make something happen here. Even as re-signing conversations stalled out in the final stretch of last season, DeRozan joked that negotiating with the team was like reasoning with a spouse after a fight: “What do we need to do to work on this, baby? Let’s figure this thing out. You want me. I want you.” The love never fully ran out. That was clear on the court, where DeRozan was always undeniably, recklessly invested. He played hurt.

Credit: Kyle Terada-USA TODAY Sports Is Jaylen Brown's controversy a sign of deeper issues within the team? USA basketball’s managing director, Grant Hill, has been caught in a wave of controversies since the Olympics began. It started with Jaylen Brown‘s exclusion from the squad, and then Jayson Tatum not receiving enough playing time during the Olympic games. Even though Hill said that he would consider Brown in the 2028 Olympic squad, things have not cooled down yet. Team USA went to the Olympics with a star-studded lineup, which comprised 12 players top-tier NBA players. Yes, they won the gold, but it was not all sunshine and rainbows behind the scenes. With that much talent, not everyone got the minutes they wanted – even the big names from the NBA squads. Just look at Jayson Tatum-he ended up with multiple DNPs, as he sat out two whole games with no playing time and not everyone was happy with it. In light of that, veteran NBA analyst Brian Windhorst advised Grant Hill to pick the young players going ahead, to avoid all the drama. The idea is to start developing the young players specifically for FIBA competitions and to build a squad that is down to stick together through a few summers, leading up to big events like the 2028 Olympics. “I don’t necessarily think it’s the worst idea in the world to take all young guys to the World Cup. Like, do what they do in soccer of the Olympics and say, we are gonna take all 23 and under,” Windhorst mentioned on the ESPN podcast. ADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad “Because we[Team USA] are gonna start developing FIBA players. We are gonna say, ‘hey, commit to playing in the summer in 2026, commit to playing the summer in 27′ and you are not promised for 28’ but let’s see where it leads. Maybe there shouldn’t be, in spots 11 and 12, maybe there shouldn’t be star players there. Maybe there should be FIBA players, NBA players, don’t get me wrong, but FIBA players who have played for multiple summers in a row,” the media vet further added. Is Jaylen Brown's controversy a ticking time bomb for Team USA? React! Reactions Windhorst wants Team USA to create a crew that’s more in sync with international play. After all, it’s all about long-term growth and commitment, not just banking on NBA stars. Talking about NBA stars though, what’s been brewing between Grant Hill and Jaylen Brown? Let’s dive deep. It was not that long ago that Jaylen Brown took a shot at Team USA and Nike, letting everyone know he was not cool with Team USA picking his Celtics teammate, Derrick White, as Kawhi Leonard‘s replacement instead of him. The current finals MVP tweeted, “@nike this what we doing.” Brown was probably implying it was Nike that kept him off the Team USA roster. ADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad In response, Hill said, “And, so, whatever theories that might be out there, they’re just that. But that’s my responsibility. And it’s tough. It’s tough to have conversations, tell people that they’re not on the team.” Jaylen Brown did not take too kindly to being called a conspiracy theorist by the USAB managing director, as he shot back, stating, “Grant Hill calling me a conspiracy theorist is disappointing. I’ve been a VP [of the NBPA] since I was 21 years old, I have a great understanding.” However, Grant Hill now wants to squash the beef. He is even open to having Brown on the Team USA squad in the 2028 Olympics. “It’s a lot of noise. I’m confident he and I will sit down at some point and talk about it and get to some level of understanding. He’ll be a candidate, if he wants, in 2028. One thing I’ve learned, you can’t take anything personally in this role. I haven’t personalized anything. My objective, my goal, is to win. And as soon as, hopefully, that happens, we pivot and start looking ahead to the future,” Hill said. As this might have been the last season for many of the veteran players in the Olympics, there will probably be space for Jaylen Brown on the Team USA roster for the 2028 Olympics. But the question is, after all that has happened, will Brown accept the offer to be a part of Team USA? What are your thoughts?

Sports After signing a historic $304 million extension, Jaylen Brown set out on a valiant goal. He wanted to bring back ‘Black Wall Street’ in Boston. Living up to his vows, Brown launched Boston XChange, an initiative to help empower underserved communities and bridge the vast wealth gaps in the city. But why stop at Boston? Only days after the Boston initiative, Brown, in collaboration with Dallas Maverick’s head coach Jason Kidd has launched the Oakland XChange. The aim remains the same, to improve the community and help upscale underrepresented businesses. To do so, the reigning Finals rivals let their common love for Oakland make possible the launch of the empowerment initiative. Through the Oakland XChange, Jaylen Brown and Kidd hope to raise $5 billion to assist the community and its businesses by providing the resources and knowledge necessary to grow their projects. Additionally, they are also partnering with Oakstop, an organization that has worked to develop the Oakland community over the past 10 years. ADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad     A post shared by NBPA (@thenbpa)  Their primary motive is to raise sufficient funds to buy real estate assets that will be dedicated as space for creator businesses. “Giving resources back to our community and allowing them to have opportunities, I think, is key. The wealth gap is widening in other places of the US, not just Boston, so to be able to invest in our community is important,” said Jaylen Brown, an alumnus of the University of California. Jason Kidd also celebrated the initiative as an ‘off-court championship’ in partnership with Brown. The Hall of Fame point guard is a native of Oakland and has invested heavily in the community. ADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad While it’s been a busy week for Jaylen Brown, it has been a memorable one for Team USA. Both the men’s and women’s basketball teams that traveled to Paris achieved the expected gold medals. Likewise, the NBA community was bursting with pride. Brown’s teammates, Jayson Tatum, Derrick White, and Jrue Holiday all were a part of the gold medal roster. But even then, probably alluding to his ongoing rift with USAB, Jaylen Brown didn’t release any statement over the team’s Paris success. In the past, the Celtics Finals MVP has criticized the board for excluding him from the squad. Furthermore, he went as far as igniting a war with Nike, pinning them for his snub. ADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad However, despite getting off on the wrong foot, team director Grant Hill has left the door open for Jaylen Brown to join the 2028 Olympic team when the competition will be held in Los Angeles. The 27-year-old community leader is yet to have made his allegiance clear. But after Tatum’s lackluster Paris experience, there is a chance the Boston pair decide against participating in 2028.

Kevin Jairaj-USA TODAY Sports Jaylen Brown vs. Nike—Who's in the wrong here? Share your thoughts! From appearance alone, there are no reservations when looking at the adorned Team USA Olympic team. Packed with the best of the league, youngsters, and veterans, there is no weakness. However, a major point of discussion was the exclusion of Jaylen Brown. As the reigning Finals MVP, Brown felt sour about being excluded, even blaming Nike. But with three other Celtics teammates on the roster, did the organization make an effort to push his case? Recently, Celtics president Brad Stevens spoke to the Boston Globe about the entire situation. Having seen Brown’s dexterity for years, Stevens had no doubt over his capabilities. But at the same time, the former head coach of the Celtics isn’t one to meddle in the process. Although he did put in a good word. “I just tell everybody how great our guys are, and then I stay out of it. I think that’s my role. I think Jaylen could be on any Olympic team any given year. He could be a featured part of those teams. I saw [USA Basketball director Grant Hill] said he’d love to sit down and talk to him about being part of that pool in ‘28, whatever that may be,” Stevens told the Boston Globe.

Additionally, Grant also previously revealed his having a conversation with Brown’s agent and explaining “it was really truly a basketball decision”. Jaylen Brown though seems unconvinced and has proclaimed to speak more in-depth about his exclusion at a later time. While it isn’t a pleasant situation, Stevens feels the 27-year-old will return with a vengeance. Even before the Paris Olympics saga, Jaylen Brown was among the best combo guards in the entire league. His fervor during the postseason showed flashes of his true potential as he improved as a defender and became the focal attack point. His diligent efforts were rewarded with MVPs in both the ECF and the NBA Finals. ADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad But is there another level to his basketball gifts? Stevens feels the Olympics snub will motivate Jaylen Brown to evolve his game a step further. “But I think Jaylen is one of the best players in the world. And one of the best things about Jaylen is whether he gets the call and makes the team or doesn’t get the call, he’s going to use it as motivation to get better. So I know he’s working and he’s excited about improving. I think he’ll truly embrace the challenges that come with winning last year. That’s who he’s always been. And this will probably add more fuel to his fire. But he doesn’t need much fuel added. He finds it,” Stevens said. The NBA landscape has changed drastically in the months since the Celtics claimed their 18th title. Teams such as the New York Knicks and Philadelphia 76ers have made major trades in the offseason. Similar to the West, the East is no longer a one-sided conference. The Celtics will face much severe competition, not only due to the improved teams but also their status as the current champions. ADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad And it’s never easy to repeat. At the same time, the Celtics are looking to begin a dynasty spearheaded by Jaylen Brown and Jayson Tatum. With the sweet taste of victory, the prolific duo is not one to let the competition steal what’s theirs. Nor are the Celtics a team that likes to lose.

Jaylen Brown,USA Basketball: Grant Hill says Jaylen Brown will be considered for 2028 Olympics after omission in Paris,https://www.cbssports.com/olympics/news/usa-basketball-grant-hill-says-jaylen-brown-will-be-considered-for-2028-olympics-after-omission-in-paris/,"If not listed, please contact your TV provider. USA Basketball director Grant Hill hopes to clear the air with Boston Celtics forward Jaylen Brown. Brown took issue with not being selected as a replacement on the 2024 Paris Olympics roster after Kawhi Leonard withdrew from the team. Team USA elected to choose Brown's Celtics teammate Derrick White for the open roster spot, leading to Brown calling out USA Basketball and Nike, the official apparel brand for Team USA.  Brown implied on social media that Nike was the reason he was kept off the team, to which Hill responded at the time, saying in part, ""Whatever theories that might be out there, they're just that. But that's my responsibility. And it's tough. It's tough to have conversations, tell people that they're not on the team.""  Brown then shot back on social media, calling out Hill, saying, ""Grant Hill calling me a conspiracy theorist is disappointing. I've been a VP [of the NBPA] since I was 21 years old I have a great understanding.""  While the dust had settled on the situation since the Olympics started, Hill said on the Open Run podcast with Rachel Nichols that he hopes to talk with Brown and that he will be considered for the 2028 Los Angeles Olympics.  ""When you have a team with the profile of players on this team, you know there's going to be controversy. You know that coming in, I knew that. I think what people fail to realize is I'm a fan of basketball, and I'm a fan of these guys that are playing in the current era...My whole approach is to celebrate the greatness of today's players. So yeah it was disappointing. You gotta do your job, I've tried to do this the right way. When we first put out the roster back in April, before it was announced, I called certain guys. I called Paul George, Damian Lillard, Jaylen Brown, I felt like they were of a certain stature where they deserved to hear it before it was made public. And I appreciated their willingness to want to be a part of this, but also wanted them to appreciate just how difficult this was. To me that was leading with integrity, doing the right thing, recognizing who they are, what they've meant to USA basketball in years past."" 	 ... 	 ""It's a lot of noise, I'm confident he and I will sit down at some point and talk about it and get to some level of understanding. He'll be a candidate, if he wants, in 2028. One thing I've learned, you can't take anything personal in this role. I haven't personalized anything, my objective, my goal is to win. And as soon as, hopefully, that happen, we pivot and start looking ahead to the future.""  Brown certainly has the resume to make the USA Basketball roster, especially after this season, during which he finished as an NBA champion and Finals MVP while leading the Celtics throughout the postseason to their first title since 2008. But making the roster for USA Basketball is the most difficult team to make, given all the talent. You could argue that he should've been named the replacement over White, but there were very good reasons to have White on the roster over Brown, too. While Team USA looks on pace to earn its fifth straight gold medal, the 2028 Olympics will be a total change of guard for the men's basketball team. LeBron James could be retired, and Kevin Durant and Stephen Curry will be 39 and 40 years old, respectively, so naturally, there will be more room for Brown to be on the roster. Hill sounds more than ready to bury the hatchet; we'll just have to see if Brown is willing to do the same. © 2004-2024 CBS Interactive. All Rights Reserved.

Tyson Chandler,"Conor McGregor's next fight will be against Michael Chandler, whose nickname is a homage to Mike Tyson",https://talksport.com/sport/mma/1325717/conor-mcgregor-michael-chandler-fight-nickname-mike-tyson/,"Conor McGregor is fighting a man inspired by the great Mike Tyson when he returns to the octagon this year. The Irishman has been out of action since fracturing his tibia and fibula in his trilogy fight defeat to Dustin Poirier at UFC 264 in July 2021, but now has a confirmed plan for his comeback, which will see him face Michael Chandler. UFC president Dana White announced on Saturday that McGregor and Chandler will work as coaches on the company's reality series, The Ultimate Fighter, before fighting at the end of the season. As yet, the date has not been set. Chandler's nickname, 'Iron', is inspired by boxing's heavyweight legend 'Iron' Mike Tyson. He did not begin his career with the moniker, though, and only adopted it after meeting Tyson in person. Following his win over Eddie Alvarez - whom McGregor later beat - for the Bellator lightweight title in 2011, Chandler spotted a long queue of people while walking with a friend through a mall in Las Vegas. It turned out that the line led to a Tyson autograph signing. “Tyson gave me some advice,” Chandler revealed. “He just said, ‘Champ, it’s easy coming up. Then as soon as you get the belt and everyone’s gunning for you. Every single person’s looking at you, they’re waking up, thinking about fighting you, they’re going to bed, thinking about fighting you.' ""He said, 'You’ve got this big target on your back. That should motivate you. You’ve got to do things right. You’ve got to work hard."" Tyson earned the nickname 'Iron Mike' in his heyday as boxing's heavyweight king, tearing through the division and becoming the youngest champion in heavyweight history in 1986. Now, Chandler is once again the hunter, rather than the hunted, as he will be looking to take McGregor's scalp later this year. Get up to £40 in free bets* - CLAIM HERE 18+ New customers only.

LaMarcus Aldridge,LaMarcus Aldridge retires as one of his generation's unluckiest and most underappreciated NBA superstars,https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/lamarcus-aldridge-retires-as-one-of-his-generations-unluckiest-and-most-underappreciated-nba-superstars/,"If not listed, please contact your TV provider. An undercurrent of disrespect permeated LaMarcus Aldridge's 2015 free agency. For a week that July, he was the center of the NBA universe, the lone championship-altering force on a market accustomed to players just a hair greater. Aldridge was never LeBron James or Kevin Durant, but for that one week, he was treated like it, and it was a feeling he seemingly wanted to replicate in perpetuity. Despite winning 105 games in his last two seasons in Portland, reports indicated that his desire to compete for championships was matched or perhaps exceeded by his longing for validation. Adrian Wojnarowski even reported at the time that Aldridge ""loathed"" driving around Portland and seeing the many billboards Adidas had posted featuring teammate Damian Lillard. Free agency was an opportunity to win, but more importantly, it was an opportunity to do so on his own terms.  It's something Aldridge -- who announced his retirement for the second time on Friday -- never really got to do in 16 NBA seasons. He started his career as the third wheel to a preordained Brandon Roy-Greg Oden dynasty, and by the time injuries ruined it, Lillard's ascent rendered him a sidekick on the only team he'd ever known. The egalitarian theory of the Spurs offered an alternative that Kawhi Leonard's brilliance swallowed in practice. Aldridge asked for a trade after his second season in San Antonio and rescinded it only after Leonard's injury granted him the spotlight he so craved but never quite deserved. The Aldridge-led Spurs were good. They made the playoffs. But without a Leonard-caliber leading man, Aldridge was never going to win a championship.  It makes his career an interesting case study in compromise. Sidekicking is notoriously tedious. Stars routinely grumble about the sacrifices it takes to win alongside superior teammates, but Aldridge never got the chance. He reached the conference finals only once, and by the time he was willing to sacrifice enough of the trappings of stardom to reach the absolute highest levels of winning, it was too late. Aldridge played only five games on the contending 2020-21 Nets before a heart condition ended his season. He played 47 more games for the Nets in 2021-22, but the team fell way short of expectations. It was the least satisfying possible outcome for Aldridge's career: he never held the keys to a franchise as Lillard does now, nor did he have the chance to ride shotgun on the way to someone else's championship.  It was ultimately a case of poor luck on both fronts, and it dates back to the very beginning of his career. The Toronto Raptors held the No. 1 overall pick in the 2006 NBA Draft, and despite the pleas of fellow Texan Chris Bosh, opted for Andrea Bargnani as their top choice. That robbed Aldridge of an ideal long-term frontcourt partner, a modern mismatch machine of a duo that would have drawn opposing bigs out of the paint a full decade before they were ready to. One pick later, the Chicago Bulls drafted him at No. 2, and for a moment, the chance to serve as Michael Jordan's long-awaited successor could have made Aldridge one of the league's brightest young stars. That pick's original owner offered similar marketability. Had they not traded for Eddy Curry, Aldridge may well have begun his career as the face of the New York Knicks.  But big market fame eluded him after a trade to Portland that should have earned him some jewelry. Injuries to Oden and Roy and then Leonard in San Antonio only scratch the surface of why it didn't. The 2013-14 Blazers started the season 31-9 before injuries to Aldridge cost them a possible 60-win season. A year later, Portland trailed only the nascent Warriors in the Western Conference standings when Wes Matthews tore his Achilles and knocked the Blazers out of championship contention. Neither was Aldridge's best team, though. That honor belongs to the historically overlooked 2016 Spurs.  Fun fact: the 73-win Warriors of 2016 didn't have the NBA's best point differential. San Antonio's plus-11.1 net rating outpaced Golden State's plus-10.6. The Spurs had the NBA's No. 4-ranked offense and best overall defense, but ran into a Durant-shaped buzzsaw in the second round of the postseason. Durant's Warriors knocked Aldridge and the Spurs out of the postseason again a year later when Leonard landed on Zaza Pachulia's foot in what would have been a Game 1 rout. Just like that, Aldridge's title hopes were dashed. His loss, ironically, was the gain of one of his draftmates. Kyle Lowry also had a brief window to contend with Leonard, but when that very Raptors team that didn't draft Aldridge ran into Durant in 2019, the player that deprived Aldridge of his title was injured.  Lowry will forever be remembered as a champion based on that run, and justifiably so, but he benefited from circumstances that deprived Aldridge of the same privilege. By most traditional measures of individual success—points, All-Star appearances, All-NBA nods, career earnings—his career was superior. It won't be remembered quite as fondly without that feather in his cap. It's no wonder Aldridge was so image-conscious in 2015. Portland couldn't give him a championship, but it couldn't give him what it gave Lillard, either.  It makes legislating his legacy a somewhat complicated affair. Aldridge fits in no defined box and his career has no identifiable arc. He was a constant, never changing a mid-range shooting style that carried him from evolutionary to anachronism across a changing league. For over a decade, he flirted with the traditional benchmark of big man stardom—the coveted ""20 and 10"" status symbol that has long since gone out of fashion—yet between 2008 and 2018, his scoring never deviated by more than six points per game. He just kept chugging along, putting up All-Star caliber numbers on teams only locals and league pass junkies ever watched. It irked Aldridge enough to take matters into his own hands. He asked for trades in 2013 and 2017 and used free agency to change teams in 2015, always looking for something slightly different. Perhaps sensing the end was near, he used a recent buyout to take one last swing at the championship that eluded him. But in the grand scheme of his career, it seems appropriate that he won't end up winning one. Not because he isn't deserving, but because without one, the discourse will have to meet him on his terms. Remembering LaMarcus Aldridge means reckoning with an often unsatisfying career, but an enormously successful one regardless.  Those unkind circumstances can enforce a somewhat more honest conversation about who Aldridge was as a player. There is no easy narrative, no legendary team, or mind-boggling statistic to condense his contributions into. He won't be on billboards now that his career is over. He was just a great player whose talent was narrowly beaten out by his poor luck. That luck robbed him of the attention his talent warranted during his career. With some distance, it's praise he more than deserves in retirement.  © 2004-2024 CBS Interactive. All Rights Reserved. CBS Sports is a registered trademark of CBS Broadcasting Inc.

Aaron Davidson/Getty Images) Scottie Pippen's kids are thriving—do you think they’ll follow in his legendary footsteps? Scotty Pippen Jr. often makes it to the headlines, but the other kids of the ex-Bulls Star? Not so much. Many basketball enthusiasts would still know of Pip’s 4 children with Larsa. However, not much is reported about the other three children that the 6x NBA champ had before them. Notably, these three children come from three different exes of Scottie Pippen — Karen McCollum, Sonya Roby, and Yvette Deleone. Let’s have a closer look at not just Pip’s 7 children, but also at what they have been up to. And what kind of bond do they share with their father? ADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad The fans of the 7x All-Star would know that long before Larsa, Pippen was married to Karen McCollum. And it was with his first wife that he welcomed his firstborn — Antron — into this world in December 1987. Growing up in Lawrenceville, he played basketball for South Georgia Technical College and later for the World Basketball Association in 2013. If one is to believe Scottie, his son was a late bloomer, but still better than him in high school. Poll 1 of 4  Which of Scottie Pippen's seven kids do you think will make the biggest impact in sports? Antron Pippen Scotty Pippen Jr. Preston Pippen Sierra Pippen Justin Pippen Sophia Pippen Taylor Pippen Have an interesting take?  Join Debate Who do you think handled the Anthony Edwards and Adidas controversy better? Anthony Edwards Adidas Noah Lyles Usain Bolt Have an interesting take?  Join Debate Do you think Dennis Rodman was a good father to Alexis? Yes No It's complicated Not sure Have an interesting take?  Join Debate Which of Devin Booker's rumored relationships surprised you the most? Kendall Jenner Jordyn Woods Christina Nadin Hannah Harrison Have an interesting take?  Join Debate But before we could see more of Antron’s basketball talents on the big stage, he passed away at 33. Although Pip never revealed the exact cause of death, he shared in an IG post that his son suffered from chronic asthma. “He never let that get him down, though — Antron stayed positive and worked hard, and I am so proud of the man that he became,” read the post. This was the 6x NBA champ’s only child with his first wife.       A post shared by Scottie Pippen (@scottiepippen)  His second child came into this world in July 1994 with his ex-girlfriend, Sonya Roby. The fact he did not want to accept the parental responsibility of his first daughter may surprise some fans. As per the information by the Associated Press, he accepted Taylor Pippen as his daughter only after a DNA test disapproved of his denial. Following this, Scottie Pippen agreed to provide financial support, while Roby retained the full custody of her daughter. But it turns out his relationship with his eldest daughter remained limited to this arrangement itself. “I know that people expect a lot from me, but, after all these years, I have learned that Pippen is just that, a last name,” Taylor said in an interview. But her development into an accomplished athlete proves that the apple doesn’t fall from the tree, no matter what. Not only did Taylor play volleyball for Southern Illinois University, but went pro in Spain for one season in 2016.  By 2024, she became the Vice President of Commercial Banking at JP Morgan Chase & Co. Notably, Taylor also had a twin sister named Tyler, but she died soon after her birth at the hospital itself. As for Pip’s last child before marrying Larsa, he had yet again denied being the father. After a paternity suit by his ex-girlfriend, Yvette Deleone, the court revealed Scottie to be the father of Sierra Pippen. The ex-Bulls star eventually reached a settlement, where he agreed to cover all the educational and other expenses of his daughter born in February 1995. Having attended the University of Iowa, Sierra believes in keeping the rest of her personal life mostly to herself. Most hardcore fans of the 7x All-Star would remember Pip marrying Larsa in July 1997, and welcoming his first son with her — Scotty Pippen Jr. — in November 2000. Pippen Jr. has reached the highest level of basketball among any of his children. However, it’s not as if the journey was easy for him just because he carried a certain surname. In fact, despite averaging impressive numbers in his college days for Vanderbilt Commodores, Pippen Jr. went undrafted in 2022. But he later made his way to the Los Angeles Lakers through a two-way deal under which he played for the franchise’s G-League team as well. But he did not get much of a chance at the big league until he moved to the Memphis Grizzlies.        A post shared by NBA G League (@nbagleague)  ADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad Meanwhile, Pip’s second child with Larsa is the complete opposite of his elder brother. As per an article by PEOPLE, Scottie Pippen’s second son with the RHOM star, Preston Pippen, likes to stay away from the spotlight. And this is the reason we don’t have many updates on him following his high school basketball life. While Preston likes to stay away from the spotlight, his younger brother Justin seems to have thrived under it. Notably, apart from trying his hands at basketball, Pip’s youngest son also gave modeling a try. Additionally, Justin appeared in True Faces of the World campaign in 2016 with his sister Sophia. The campaign reportedly featured kids with different backgrounds and cultures. Now, Scottie Pippen’s youngest, and last child with Larsa, is his daughter Sophia. And she has the luxury of making the surprising claim that her godmother is Kim Kardashian. Larsa’s friendship with Kim may have reportedly suffered a blow after her split with Kanye West. But it seems that the goddaughter-godmother connection still remains. Now, it’s important to highlight that though Pip’s relationship with his other children is not so sorted, he shares a great bond with all his children with Larsa.  ADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad Stay tuned for more such updates.

Ndamukong Suh,"I played with Tom Brady, beat Patrick Mahomes to Super Bowl and learned to embrace 'hated' tag from Nike billionaire",https://talksport.com/sport/1607565/ndamukong-suh-tom-brady-super-bowl-mahomes-phil-knight/,"Ndamukong Suh was Tom Brady's Super Bowl-winning teammate, received critical life advice from Nike co-founder Phil Knight, and was once best known as the most hated player in the NFL.  Now that Suh is entering the media world while still searching for an ideal playing situation - like he found last season with the Philadelphia Eagles - one of the best defenders during the last two decades is opening up and revealing the real man behind the facemask.  ""I did everything that it took and played right to the edge,"" Suh exclusively told talkSPORT. ""For me, you're not supposed to like me. And I'm not doing my job if you do like me."" Suh -- who was again linked with the Miami Dolphins after Bradley Chubb's injury -- was open, honest and at ease during the interview in London, where he's been living for the last month while working as an NFL analyst for Sky Sports. The five-time Pro Bowler with 600 career tackles, 71.5 sacks and three Super Bowl appearances also wasn't afraid to say what he really thinks, which wasn't the case during his early playing days when he realized he'd been painted as a classic NFL bad guy. ""I started to learn, man, (the media) need to have hot stories and they need to have people to talk about,"" he said. ""They also need to have the pretty boy in Tom Brady, the All Star in Peyton Manning and you've got to have the villain.  ""I was one of those villains that fit in perfectly. Just from that standpoint, I started to embrace those things and I really learned that from Phil Knight."" Mentioning Brady soon had Suh reflecting on Tampa Bay's 2020 season, which initially was filled with drama and question marks but ended with a dominant 31-9 victory over Patrick Mahomes and the Kansas City Chiefs in Super Bowl LV. Brady was a ""great teammate,"" Suh said. The greatest quarterback of all time also put in the necessary work and knew how to get the best out of his teammates.  ""I see why he's so good, just because of his work ethic and the things that he builds himself off, and that mindset and focus,"" Suh said.  ""But as a true champion - and this is what I learned earlier on in my career, in probably my second and third year - you're only as good as the people around you. If they're not bought into how you work and you can't make them better, you will not move far."" The 13-year veteran remembers a challenging mid-season conversation within the Buccaneers in 2020 that changed Tampa Bay's year and pointed Bruce Arians' team toward the top of the world. ""Guys look how talented we are and we're playing at such an average level,"" Suh recalled. ""It's not because of our talent. It's because we haven't come together as a unit and stopped being selfish."" Arians was the perfect sideline leader for those Bucs and rivals Jim Caldwell as the best coach that Suh has played for.  ""Bruce is like, 'You guys want to win? It's on you.' Like, I'm going to give you everything,"" Suh said. ""I'm going to listen to you. You guys want to change things, you want to run practice differently, you want to do it this way, do it that way, we'll do it. But at the end of the day, you have ownership in this."" The 2010 Defensive Rookie of the Year took Arians' advice to heart when Tampa Bay had two weeks to prepare for the big game against Mahomes and the Chiefs. Suh said that he told then-defensive coordinator Todd Bowles that a normal blitz-heavy scheme needed to be tweaked to take down a Kansas City offense that would attack the Bucs' secondary.  ""We'll attack with this front seven and, trust me, we will get there,"" Suh said. ""We just ate that offensive line and their offense alive, because we had that confidence and we knew what we were going to do and we were all on the same page and we believed."" Last year, Suh believed that he had his second world championship wrapped up.  Philadelphia led Mahomes' team 24-14 at halftime, with Jalen Hurts outplaying the biggest Chief and the Eagles just 30 minutes away from a shining trophy. ""All we needed to do was on the defensive side of the ball -- because offense was lights out the entire time -- just take care of our responsibility,"" Suh said. ""And I feel in some cases we got outcoached and outplayed in the second half of that game, and obviously that led to us losing the match. ""Those emotions going through that, having lost my first Super Bowl and then winning my second Super Bowl, to be able to have an opportunity and be in that position to where you're like 30 minutes away from being a Super Bowl champion for the second time, that really stung."" Suh would have retired after the 2022 season if the Eagles had won it all.  Instead, one of the game's fiercest defenders relied on his young children to help him get through the pain of losing another game on the NFL's biggest stage. ""If we had won, I would have probably been done,"" Suh said. ""Walk away being a champion and then ride off into the sunset and see what the media world had for me."" He added: ""The only thing that really probably got me through that was knowing I'm coming home to my kids. They don't know a difference. They're barely 2. They're just excited."" A two-game suspension in 2011 for stomping on a Green Bay Packers player ended up being a life changer for Suh, thanks to a private conversation with Knight. ""I went home (to Oregon) and Phil Knight asked me to come meet him in his office at Nike where I trained every offseason, even to this day,"" Suh said. ""And we just had an amazing hour, hour and a half conversation, and he just laid it out to me."" Suh became more in control of his playing style, career focus and overall image. Twelve years later, he's waiting on one more NFL call while exploring the media world. After winning a Super Bowl with Brady and spending more than a decade as one of the league's biggest villains, Suh believes that his powerful career should end up in Canton, Ohio.  ""I don't regret anything,"" Suh said. ""I love every moment of my career and hopefully that will surmount to me being a Hall of Fame player once I do decide to retire.""

Steve Kerr Decision Could Make Team USA a Boston Celtics Powerhouse, Here's How",https://www.essentiallysports.com/nba-active-basketball-news-will-jayson-tatum-lead-the-charge-in-two-thousand-twenty-eight-olympics-steve-kerr-decision-could-make-team-usa-a-boston-celtics-powerhouse-here-s-how/,"More Sports ES Fancast Aug 11, 2024 | 7:57 PM EDT Can Jayson Tatum turn Team USA into a Celtics-dominated powerhouse in the 2028 Olympics? The announcement of the 2024 Olympics roster drew criticism from many. With the kind of talent available in the NBA and the no. of players willing to play, disagreements were more than bound to happen. But soon, another controversy pretty much rocked the Olympic boat. Steve Kerr, deciding not to play Jayson Tatum in the tournament opener, really ruffled serious feathers. But then again, taking a look at the whole Team USA campaign, Kerr has been at the receiving end of the short stick for his player combinations. Come 2028, when the next round of the Olympics rolls up, it seems like the USA Basketball board could very well turn into a Celtics powerhouse. For one, choosing Derrick White, over 2024 Finals MVP Jaylen Brown, after Kawhi Leonard withdrew his candidature, had put Managing Director Grant Hill in the spotlight—and not the good kind. At the time, Hill calmed the crowd with a promise. If Brown was willing, he’d have a place in the 2028 Olympic roster. And for all the Tatum fans, this new Evan Sidery update on X would also prove to be quite a relief. “Steve Kerr is likely to retire as Team USA head coach, which means a new lead voice for 2028 in Los Angeles. Erik Spoelstra is viewed as the strong internal favorite to become Team USA’s next in line following Gregg Popovich and Kerr.” ADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad Along with Kerr, LeBron James, Kevin Durant, and Stephen Curry – the three-headed hydra of Team USA- are also likely to be retiring. While it’s true that it’s a tough position to fill, it’s still vacant. And by 2028, there’s no doubt that JT, JB, and White would very well adorn the veteran badge. And if the 30-year-old is still a Celtic, Team USA would, in effect, be a ‘Celtics powerhouse’. Poll 1 of 4  Do you think Jayson Tatum can lead Team USA to Olympic gold in 2028?

And they went public with their criticism. The head coach, however, has played it diplomatic across the board and he delivered on the promise of bringing the Gold medal back home. Even though the critics couldn’t say much after that, as even Jayson was seen sharing a broad smile with his teammates, let’s dive deeper and see what his mother and franchise owner had to say earlier. It was only a matter of time before Brandy Cole would be forced to put her foot down. Her son just led his team to an NBA title in the wake of the best record in the league. He earned a spot on the All-NBA first team for 3 years straight and received All-Star recognition for 5 years! So yes, Mama Tatum was indignant. And she made sure to let Kerr know of it when she replied to a tweet from ESPN’s Dick Vitale. “Someone pls let me know is @jaytatum0 injured as he hasn’t received the PT ( playing time ) u would expect an All NBA player to get,” Vitale posted from his X account. Cole immediately took the chance to re-tweet with a dig of her own. “No he not. But if you find out what’s going on please let me know – unacceptable and makes NO SENSE.” If Kerr thought JT’s mom was the only one who had some words for him, think again. ADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad Kerr’s actions also stupefied Boston’s majority owner, Grousbeck. Appearing on the Greg Hill Show, recently, he said, “I mean, I wouldn’t play Steve Kerr. Let me put it that way… It’s a complete mystery. I think Jayson doesn’t deserve anything but praise, kudos and playing time. I think he and Jaylen [Brown] led us to this unbelievable championship and they’re not apparently helping the Olympic team. It’s mystifying.” Clearly, there are a lot of people who are unhappy with Steve Kerr. But even amid such disappointing circumstances, Jayson Tatum has his fill of happiness. The NBA championship, obviously. But the Tatum family welcomed another member. After the Team USA win, the 2x Olympian and his family posed for family portraits, and who else to join them, but Grammy winning-singer and Tatum’s baby mama, Ella Mai? Anyway, the 2028 Team USA roster is going to be very interesting. If not for anything else, to see if Grant Hill makes good on his word. What do you think?

Enes Freedom,Enes Kanter Freedom slams LeBron James over China after scoring record,https://nypost.com/2023/02/08/enes-kanter-freedom-slams-lebron-james-over-china-after-scoring-record/,"Enes Kanter Freedom took a jab at LeBron James after the Lakers star surpassed Kareem Abdul-Jabbar to become the NBA’s all-time leading scorer on Tuesday.  The free-agent big man — who was waived by the Rockets in February 2022, a few days after the Celtics traded him to Houston — sent a sarcastic message to James on Twitter after the historic moment.  “38,388 Points, 0 Morals, 0 Values, 0 Principles, 0 Empathy, 1 bow down to China” Freedom wrote on Twitter. “Congratulations to @KingJames.”  James has yet to publicly address Freedom’s tweet. The criticism, though, was not surprising as Freedom is a longtime critic of James.  The 11-year NBA veteran has disapproved of both the NBA’s and of James’ silence on human rights atrocities in China, and has spoken out against authoritarian regimes.  38,388 Points 0 Morals0 Values0 Principles0 Empathy1 Bow Down to #ChinaCongratulations to @KingJames Advertisement In November 2021, the Swiss-born, Turkish-raised center became an American citizen and legally changed his last name to “Freedom” amid his human rights activism.  That same month, Freedom wore sneakers on the court trolling James with an illustration that depicted him bowing to China’s president, Xi Jinping, as he put a crown on James’ head.  Freedom condemned James’ business with Nike and accused the brand of telling a “total lie” about China’s alleged use of slave labor to produce its products. Nike has denied using slave labor. “Money over Morals for the ‘King,’” Freedom tweeted in November 2021. “Sad & disgusting how these athletes pretend they care about social justice.” Freedom was also critical of James’ comments in 2019, when James criticized Daryl Morey’s support for Hong Kong. At the time, James said Morey, who at the time was the Rockets’ GM and is now the 76ers’ president of basketball operations, was “misinformed” and “not educated” as Hong Kong citizens were protesting incursions on their freedom by the Chinese Communist Party. James refused to offer his own thoughts about China’s political policies at the time, saying that he had to do more research on the issue. Last January, Kanter told Fox News that a teammate of James had approached him and told him to keep applying pressure on James. Kanter, a former first-round pick by the Jazz in the 2011 draft, had stints with the Thunder, Knicks, Trail Blazers and Celtics before Boston traded him to the Rockets in February 2022.  Four days later, Kanter was waived by Houston and later alleged that it was due to his views about the Chinese government.  In August, Freedom told The Post that he believed he is being blackballed by the NBA due to his outspoken criticism of the league’s relationship with China. At the time, he said he did not receive a single offer over the summer in free agency.  “I knew there was a price to pay. And I don’t regret my actions,” Freedom said. “These things are bigger than me, bigger than the NBA, and bigger than basketball. While I am playing in the USA, people are being killed all over the world or imprisoned or tortured in prisons. If this is the sacrifice I need to make, I am ready to live with it.”  NBA commissioner Adam Silver denied that Freedom is being blackballed while speaking to the New York Times last March.

Enes Freedom,Ex NBA star Enes Kanter has $500K Turkish bounty on his head,https://nypost.com/2023/01/12/ex-nba-star-enes-kanter-has-500k-turkish-bounty-on-his-head/,"Former NBA star Enes Kanter Freedom — who famously amended his name after becoming a US citizen in 2021 — is officially a wanted man. Not only is his name on 2023’s most-wanted terrorists list, but this is the first time his former country has actually placed a published bounty on people’s heads. President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan’s government is offering up to 10 million Turkish Lira, or roughly $500,000, for information leading to the capture of Freedom, who said he found out about it a week ago. “That makes it so dangerous,” Freedom, 30, told The Post. “Before the bounty, Turkish intelligence were after the people on the list, but now everyone is after them because they want the money.” He also revealed that he is looking into suing the NBA — “I’m waiting for the right time” — which Freedom claims has blackballed him for his public protests against China. During 11 seasons in the NBA, Freedom was known for his outspokenness, including against the Turkish government’s human rights abuses. He has called out Erdoğan for being a “dictator,” stepped on a photo of him at a protest, and even dubbed him the “Hitler of our century.”  “Because of my platform, whenever I say something, it goes everywhere and the Turkish government hates that,” Freedom said. “They’re really sick of it, and they said ‘enough is enough’ and are doing whatever they can to shut me up.” The athlete’s name appears on the Turkish Terrorist Wanted List along with actual terrorists and fellow dissidents critical of the Erdoğan regime, which has routinely defied international human rights law. The list also names more than a dozen journalists — part of a larger assault on the free press in Turkey, where the number of jailed journalists has doubled in the past year. Although Freedom, who now lives in Washington, DC, admitted the bounty ups his personal security concerns, he said is in constant contact with local law enforcement and the FBI.  “I’m being protected 24/7,” he said, adding that he is more worried for the safety of the lesser-known Turkish dissidents on Erdoğan’s list. “I’m speaking out because I am not the only one on that list,” Freedom said of the bounty. “There are so many journalists, so many activists, and so many athletes, but they aren’t as well-known as me. They are way easier targets — and they’re alone out there.” The Swiss-born, Turkish-raised, American citizen has played for the New York Knicks, the Boston Celtics and other teams during his time in the NBA. But he caused a rift in the league — which pulls in billions of dollars in revenue from China via nearly half a billion viewers — when he became an outspoken critic of Xi Jinping and the Chinese Communist Party. He’s also been critical of Nike — a major NBA advertiser and player sponsor — for its manufacturing deals in China.  Freedom became known for wearing sneakers with messages like “Free Tibet,” “Free Uyghur,” and “No Beijing 2022,” painted by dissident artists, during games and has said he was pressured by the league to take off his shoes and keep his mouth shut. His refusal to do so led to a tiff with NBA star LeBron James in 2019. “I tweeted that Hong Kong should be free. [Then] Le Bron said he is not educated enough about the situation [to comment on it] and that what I tweeted hurt the league,” Freedom told The Post in 2021. “It’s sad that these players are social justice warriors, but, when it comes to China, they are scared to say anything …  Your values are more important than any money you can ever make from China.” Now, Freedom says he’s been blackballed by the NBA. After being traded to the Houston Rockets from the Boston Celtics in February, he was quickly dropped. He averaged 11.7 minutes, 3.7 points and 4.6 rebounds last season. “The NBA is never going to admit it, but I believe I’m being blackballed,” he told The Post. “I’ve had many conversations and everyone is saying the same thing: ‘Your career has ended because of your China comments.’” Now, Freedom is “waiting for the right time” to sue the league. “They are a 100% American made organization, but they are being controlled and run by the biggest dictatorship in the world, China,” he said. “How can China fire an American citizen from an American organization? That is unacceptable.”  “The league office has had no involvement in team roster decisions involving Mr. Freedom,” NBA spokesman Mike Bass told The Post. NBA commissioner Adam Silver, speaking with the New York Times this past March, denied that Kanter is being blackballed. “We spoke directly about his activities this season,” Silver said at the time. “and I made it absolutely clear to him that it was completely within his right to speak out on issues that he was passionate about.” Since leaving the NBA, he is running interfaith basketball camps for children to foster unity and has been traveling the world to meet with leaders as a human rights activist.  Although 2023 is the first year Freedom appeared on the Terrorist Wanted List, his conflict with the Turkish government is ongoing. Leaders revoked his passport in 2017 and requested an Interpol “red notice” — asking law enforcement worldwide to arrest pending extradition — in 2019. His father, Mehmet, was jailed in Turkey, and the family was forced to disown Freedom for their own safety, the athlete said. It’s been nearly 10 years since he spoke to them—and yet they are still being harassed back in Turkey, according to Freedom. “My dad went to a market, and people spit on his face,” he said. “And my mom can’t walk outside freely because she gets harassed.” Freedom said he hopes to call attention to the Turkish government’s cruelty. “I really want to show the world what kind of person Erdoğan is. Western leaders are not doing enough. They’re playing softball with this dictatorship,” Freedom said. “Diplomacy is important, but on the other side of the world people are losing their lives, their homes and their loved ones.”  Advertisement"
Joakim Noah,Joakim Noah relishes first Manila visit,https://www.rappler.com/sports/nba/joakim-noah-relishes-first-philippines-visit-2024/," SUMMARY This is AI generated summarization, which may have errors. For context, always refer to the full article. 
						BIG MAN. Joakim Noah leads a Jr. NBA and WNBA clinic in Manila, Philippines.					 
						NBA Philippines					 MANILA, Philippines – The Filipinos’ incomparable passion for basketball once again captivated a visitor, this time former NBA big man Joakim Noah. The two-time NBA All-Star stayed in the country for about a week, doing various activities like serving as a global liquor brand ambassador, playing pickup basketball, and teaching the next generation of Filipino hoopers. “I didn’t get to see the professional leagues, but it was very interesting to see being out here and seeing how much the people in Manila really love basketball,” Noah told Rappler in an exclusive interview. “There’s a real resilience and a competitive spirit. We even played a pickup game the other day. So I definitely felt that energy from the people,” he added. “You could feel that basketball is really part of the culture.” Noah, the 2014 NBA Defensive Player of the Year, is known mostly for his time with the Chicago Bulls, helping the team during a short revival of the franchise powered by Derrick Rose. The Bulls, one of the more popular franchises in the Philippines owing to their six championships in the 1990s, continue to attract fans. As soon as he arrived from a 30-hour flight, Noah received a warm welcome from Filipinos, with the 6-foot-11 center signing autographs and gamely posing for photos. “I’m almost 40 years old and I haven’t played in a professional game in almost five years,” said Noah, who last played professionally with the Los Angeles Clippers in 2020. “And to see that the people still know the Chicago Bulls from when I was playing there 10 years ago, I feel really blessed to be here.” Noah concluded his stay in the Philippines by leading the joint Junior NBA and WNBA camp at the Gatorade Hoops Center in Mandaluyong City on Sunday, June 30. Guiding 50 teenage boys and girls, Noah was joined by Natalia Andre, an ex-pro basketball player herself. Noah also led the unveiling of the refurbished CCP Bukaneg Court located just behind the main building of the Cultural Center of the Philippines in Pasay City on Friday, June 28. The court, renovated by French cognac distiller Hennessy, is part of the company’s global initiative dubbed “In the Paint.” It was designed by local artist Kiefer “Kiefsix” Indiongco, who used indigenous elements in the color scheme. He also designed the Nike Courtyard in Taguig City, which was opened in 2023. “[Noah’s] a huge cultural activist. He’s an art enthusiast himself. He does a lot of community work and authentic collaboration with us,” program head Pascale Kalambaie said. “He does a lot of work in Africa, across the US and Asia as well, so he’s a great ambassador as well.” – Rappler.com

Sports After signing a historic $304 million extension, Jaylen Brown set out on a valiant goal. He wanted to bring back ‘Black Wall Street’ in Boston. Living up to his vows, Brown launched Boston XChange, an initiative to help empower underserved communities and bridge the vast wealth gaps in the city. But why stop at Boston? Only days after the Boston initiative, Brown, in collaboration with Dallas Maverick’s head coach Jason Kidd has launched the Oakland XChange. The aim remains the same, to improve the community and help upscale underrepresented businesses. To do so, the reigning Finals rivals let their common love for Oakland make possible the launch of the empowerment initiative. Through the Oakland XChange, Jaylen Brown and Kidd hope to raise $5 billion to assist the community and its businesses by providing the resources and knowledge necessary to grow their projects. Additionally, they are also partnering with Oakstop, an organization that has worked to develop the Oakland community over the past 10 years. ADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad     A post shared by NBPA (@thenbpa)  Their primary motive is to raise sufficient funds to buy real estate assets that will be dedicated as space for creator businesses. “Giving resources back to our community and allowing them to have opportunities, I think, is key. The wealth gap is widening in other places of the US, not just Boston, so to be able to invest in our community is important,” said Jaylen Brown, an alumnus of the University of California. Jason Kidd also celebrated the initiative as an ‘off-court championship’ in partnership with Brown. The Hall of Fame point guard is a native of Oakland and has invested heavily in the community. ADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad While it’s been a busy week for Jaylen Brown, it has been a memorable one for Team USA. Both the men’s and women’s basketball teams that traveled to Paris achieved the expected gold medals. Likewise, the NBA community was bursting with pride. Brown’s teammates, Jayson Tatum, Derrick White, and Jrue Holiday all were a part of the gold medal roster. But even then, probably alluding to his ongoing rift with USAB, Jaylen Brown didn’t release any statement over the team’s Paris success. In the past, the Celtics Finals MVP has criticized the board for excluding him from the squad. Furthermore, he went as far as igniting a war with Nike, pinning them for his snub. ADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad However, despite getting off on the wrong foot, team director Grant Hill has left the door open for Jaylen Brown to join the 2028 Olympic team when the competition will be held in Los Angeles. The 27-year-old community leader is yet to have made his allegiance clear. But after Tatum’s lackluster Paris experience, there is a chance the Boston pair decide against participating in 2028.

Jarvis Landry,Former Alabama QB Bryce Young signs endorsement deal with Jordan Brand,https://theathletic.com/4456688/2023/04/27/bryce-young-jordan-brand-contract/,"NFL Former Alabama quarterback Bryce Young is signing an endorsement deal with Jordan Brand, the Nike company announced Thursday. Here’s what you need to know: The Athletic’s instant analysis: Jordan Brand has purposefully maintained a small roster of NFL players ever since Randy Moss became their first signee in 1999 as part of an effort to maintain a sense of exclusivity about the group. With that being said, they’ve recently expanded their presence in the NFL in response to swelling interest from players. Advertisement Jordan Retro cleats have become increasingly popular and, as more notable NFL players such as Davante Adams, Dak Prescott and Cam Jordan, among others, have signed with Jordan Brand, their overall footprint in the sport ranging from youth football to high school football to college football has made significant growth. That’s reflected in Jordan Brand bringing Young on board. Young assuredly had no shortage of options to choose from for a shoe endorsement deal and ultimately chose to roll with a company known for basketball. Young, who’ll only be 22 this season, is one of just two quarterbacks signed to Jordan Brand alongside Prescott, who’ll turn 30 in July. It’s not guaranteed, obviously, but Young has a shot to become the face of Jordan Brand’s football division moving forward if he lives up to the hype. — Reed (Photo courtesy of Jordan Brand) Get all-access to exclusive stories.

Watt by buying stake in $4.4 billion football club with massive international following",https://talksport.com/football/2006335/kevin-durant-paris-saint-germain-ryan-reynolds-purchase-worth/,"Kevin Durant is joining the big money club. LeBron James, Ryan Reynolds, Tom Brady and J.J. Watt already hold special keys to the front gate. By becoming a minority shareholder of Paris Saint-Germain, an NBA superstar who just made history with his fourth Olympic gold medal in Paris has again raised the profile of the biggest sport in the world.  ""BREAKING: 2x NBA Champion Kevin Durant has invested in Paris Saint-Germain through his Boardroom Sports Holdings, LLC via Arctos Partners, the strategic minority investor in the club,"" Boardroom tweeted on Monday evening. Durant invested ""a few millions dollars of his own money"" to buy a stake in PSG, according to ESPN.  Reynolds and Rob McElhenney own Wrexham, James has a stake in Liverpool, Brady bought into Birmingham City and Watt is a Burnley investor.  Durant, a 14-time NBA All-Star, is set to make $51 million with Phoenix Suns this season and is on a four-year, $191 million contract that expires in 2026. The 35-year-old forward only trails James in scoring among active NBA players and is Team USA's all-time leading scorer in the Olympics. Durant's career earnings on the court surpass $395 million. The No. 2 overall pick of the 2007 NBA Draft started his career with the Seattle SuperSonics, made his name in Oklahoma City, and won two NBA championships with the Golden State Warriors' dynasty before bouncing to Brooklyn and Phoenix. To win his record fourth gold medal, Durant rejoined former Warriors teammate Steph Curry with Team USA in the 2024 Paris Olympics. “It’s great,” Durant told reporters, including talkSPORT, last month in London. “It’s exciting times. He’s at the point in his career where this is probably the last thing he wants to check off on a résumé."" Curry followed that up by leading Team USA to a tough win over Victor Wembanyama and France to capture gold. PSG is valued at $4.4 billion, according to Forbes, and recently was the home of Kylian Mbappe.  Lionel Messi and Neymar also were associated with the three-time defending Ligue 1 champions, who sold a minority stake to investment firm Arctos in December 2023. Qatar Sports Investments are the controlling shareholders of PSG. Durant's strong US name recognition should allow PSG to further expand into the United States market, with the 2026 World Cup being primarily played in the US. Durant collects over $45 million annually in off-the-court endorsements and has collaborated with Nike, Fanatics and FanDuel. Boardroom is a sports, media and entertainment brand co-founded by Durant, who's also purchased stakes in MLS' Philadelphia Union, NWSL's Gotham FC and a Major League Pickleball franchise. After wining the NBA Rookie of the Year with Seattle in 2007-08, Durant has averaged 27.3 points, 7 rebounds and 4.4 assists while winning two NBA Finals MVPs in his 16-year career.

Center. Mandatory Credit: Wendell Cruz-USA TODAY Sports Did Team USA drop the ball by ignoring Caitlin Clark's marketing potential? Less than 24 hours after Team USA’s men’s basketball team handed France a defeat in the finals, the women’s team did the same. They defeated the host nation by a narrow 67-66 margin on Sunday to claim their eighth consecutive gold at the Olympics. Despite these efforts and achievements, Stephen A. Smith believes, “Team USA missed an opportunity,” and he’s not apologetic for saying this. On August 13th, Smith unveiled his perspective via his official YouTube channel. “When you talk about marketing the sport, I think Team USA missed an opportunity to elevate the profile of women’s excellence in the sport of basketball because they ignored marketing,” he said after applauding Team USA’s women for returning with their eighth consecutive gold around their necks. For Smith, Caitlin Clark was an opportunity Team USA could have seized. Her addition to Team USA would have been a marketing boost. “Box office matters… we want to act like it doesn’t matter, but it does,” he added. For context, 4 of Team USA’s games over the past week drew an audience of less than 13,000. Meanwhile, the Indiana Fever alone recorded about 16,898 viewers per game for 11 straight since Clark’s arrival. ADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad He even pointed out how the men’s basketball team is taking advantage of marketing opportunities. “It’s not an accident I saw Anthony Edwards with those Adidas shoes, or LeBron James with his gold-plated shoes, but I saw that. Adidas took advantage of the marketing opportunity. LeBron took advantage of the marketing opportunity. It matters,” he added. Quite evidently, Smith seems to be right. But how has Caitlin Clark’s omission from Team USA affected her? Did Team USA just make the biggest mistake by snubbing Caitlin Clark? React! Reactions ADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad Well, it did affect her, but in a good way. In fact, it turned out to be a blessing in disguise. “I honestly can’t wait to not touch a basketball for a while,” she told The Athletic after the WNBA All-Star matchup. Most of the rookies who share similar hype haven’t had the privilege of a break. But Clark made the most of the WNBA’s 24-day Olympic break, vacationing in Mexico with her teammates and attending India State Fair. “I think relaxing and reflecting on everything that’s happened to me over the course of the last year is going to be super important because my life has moved so fast,” she added. Above all, she finally got time to relax after March 2023. Now that it’s time to return, she might have reanalyzed her WNBA rookie season, which is extremely important in the Rookie of the Year race. Her first game after the Olympics break will be against Pheonix Mercury on 17th August. What do you think? Will she be stronger and better this time?

Ronaldinho,10 Greatest No.10s in Brazil History Ranked,https://www.givemesport.com/the-10-greatest-no10s-in-brazil-history-ranked/,"Your changes have been saved  Email is sent Email has already been sent Please verify your email address. You’ve reached your account maximum for followed topics.                     In the realm of football, the No.10 shirt carries a weighty significance, not just for any team, but for the entire sport. It's a symbol of recognition, a testament to a player's skill, craft, and ability that deserves a number that stands out. Traditionally given to attacking midfielders but with the positional fluidity of modern-day football, 'No.10s' can feature across the frontline and deeper and so does the shirt number.
                         There are few clubs or nations where a shirt number holds such a profound significance as Brazil. This is a nation that has given birth to football legends like Pele, Ronaldinho, and Neymar — all of whom have proudly worn the yellow shirt with the iconic green '10' emblazoned on the back, with the latter being the most recent. With Real Madrid's Rodrygo the latest in a long line of legends to don the famous jersey at the 2024 Copa America, GIVEMESPORT has ranked the greatest Brazilians to wear the jersey over the years.
     From Ronaldo Nazario to Rivaldo, Brazil's conveyor belt of attacking talent is simply unrivalled in the world of football.                     The Premier League and its relationship with Brazilian players are bipolar, to say the least, especially in the league's formative years. However, for Juninho Paulista, the transition to English football from Brazil was as seamless as the football he plays.
                         The diminutive mercurial maestro was coined the moniker 'The Little Fella' during his spells at Middlesbrough, where his person and effortless ease posed a fascinating figure, especially at 5ft5 tall. For Brazil, that talismanic shine never withered, donning the 10 jerseys with the same authority and picking up two honours with the national team, the 2002 World Cup and the 1997 Confederations Cup.

                         An influential figure in one of Brazil's World Cup wins, Rai started the 1994 World Cup as the captain before being relieved of his duties during the tournament and benched in the latter stages, as Brazil would win the competiton on the global stage for the first time in 24 years. Yet, Rai's reputation always shone brightly among the Brazilian public. He was an adventurous player on and off the pitch who established himself as one of the most revered players in Paris Saint-Germain's history. The former Sao Paulo was a final third fiend who would latch onto any half-chance in and out of the box and use his stocky build to his advantage.

                          When Brazil clinched the 1970 World Cup, it wasn't Rivelino who wore the shirt but a certain Pelé. Rivelino, Brazil's number 11, would later have the opportunity to shine in the '74 and '78 editions wearing the No.10. Briefly seen as Pelé's sidekick, was also idolised by Diego Maradona. The Argentine legend hailed the tricky, left-footed midfielder as 'one of the best ever.' Rivelino's ability to weave through a sea of challenges and entice opponents onto him before slipping the ball into vacated space was clear to see in Maradona's game.
                         The 92-capped international is also regarded as the perfector of the 'elastico' skill, which bamboozles defences with quick feet. He learned this skill from Sergio Echigo, one of his Corinthians teammates.

                     The legend of Jair lives on even nearly 20 years after his passing. A man credited as the pioneer of Brazil's continental success before a meteoric rise on the world stage, Brazil won the 1949 Copa America before finishing runner-up in the World Cup the year after. Jair still holds the record for the most amount of goals scored at a Copa America, nine in 1949. A wide forward who drove with such intent that it created fear, Jair's failure to get Brazil over the line against Uruguay in the 1950 World Cup was his biggest regret.

     Brazilian wonderkids crop up every year, but these are the 10 best in Football Manager 2024.                     One of the three Ballon d'Or winners to feature on the list, Kaka is one of the greatest modern players to play for Brazil, let alone wear the ‘10’ shirt. The former AC Milan and Real Madrid star was one of the best players in the world in the mid to late 2000s, with multiple crowing moments in the Champions League as well as dazzling in two separate Confederations Cup-winning teams for Brazil. An attacking midfielder who could play in any era and not look out of place: A gliding swan-like style, with the nous to anticipate offensive moves before they've developed.

     Brazil have been blessed with some remarkable defenders including Cafu and Roberto Carlos.                     Neymar’s career with Brazil shouldn't be understated. He hasn't won a World Cup or secured a Copa America despite coming close in 2021, but since the age of 18, when he first put on a Selecao shirt, he has performed to an individual level not many have ever reached for the nation.
                         Mainly a left-sided player at the club level, a role on the inside as a more traditional #10 is where Neymar has operated in Brazil sides, emphasising his central role in any Brazlian coach plans, especially Dunga’s. Loathe or love him, being the country’s highest-ever goal scorer and winning Brazil’s first Olympic gold medal in Rio in 2016 warrants his inclusion on this list as the still-modern poster boy that the new generation aspires to replicate.

     Neymar has been financially rewarded in a big way, and his current net worth reflects that.                       Whilst Neymar has been seen as the epitome of the Brazilian superstar in recent generations, Ronaldinho was the original representation. A man fond of the odd party, as a player, he turned most pitches he played on into his dancefloor. After a trademark mesmerising run where he would slalom and, at times, humiliate his opposition markers and the goalkeeper before wheeling away and performing his 'Leprechaun' celebration. Despite the litany of trophies and memorable moments, Ronaldinho was a footballer that was designed to entertain - and that he did, at the highest level.

                         Out of the 15 clubs that Rivaldo has played for, he only made more appearances for one (Barcelona), than he did for Brazil. In fact, the memories of Rivaldo’s glittering seem exclusive to his peaking years for the Spanish side and his country.
                         Though a more impactful player for Barcelona than Brazil, Rivaldo’s involvement in Brazil’s 2002 World Cup triumph, wearing the No. 10 shirt, ahead of the likes of Ronaldinho and Juninho - formed a potent front two with Ronaldo Nazario that will be etched into Brazilian history.

As Pele's national team successor, Zico was thrust under the national spotlight once he took over and embraced it to the fullest degree. With the ball seemingly stuck to his feet and on a right foot that could unlock the tightest of defences, the Flamengo icon was a talismanic figure across all the teams he played for.

     From Diego Maradona to Pele, a select number of stadiums have been renamed in honour of some legendary footballers.                      Any list mentioning Brazilian footballers is often headlined by Pele. Not just regarded as one of the greatest players to play the game, if not the greatest, Pele was one of the most accomplished sports athletes ever. A haul of more than 1,000 goals only tells one half of Pele's remarkable career both domestically and internationally.
                         Ask those who have watched the great man play; it is a blessing as much as an experience, even during his brief time in the United States for New York Cosmos at the twighlight of his career. Ronaldo stated that his ""legacy transcends generations,"" a fitting description of a man who has won more World Cups than any other player in men's footballing history.

LeBron James, Ryan Reynolds, Tom Brady and J.J. Watt already hold special keys to the front gate. By becoming a minority shareholder of Paris Saint-Germain, an NBA superstar who just made history with his fourth Olympic gold medal in Paris has again raised the profile of the biggest sport in the world.  ""BREAKING: 2x NBA Champion Kevin Durant has invested in Paris Saint-Germain through his Boardroom Sports Holdings, LLC via Arctos Partners, the strategic minority investor in the club,"" Boardroom tweeted on Monday evening. Durant invested ""a few millions dollars of his own money"" to buy a stake in PSG, according to ESPN.  Reynolds and Rob McElhenney own Wrexham, James has a stake in Liverpool, Brady bought into Birmingham City and Watt is a Burnley investor.  Durant, a 14-time NBA All-Star, is set to make $51 million with Phoenix Suns this season and is on a four-year, $191 million contract that expires in 2026. The 35-year-old forward only trails James in scoring among active NBA players and is Team USA's all-time leading scorer in the Olympics. Durant's career earnings on the court surpass $395 million. The No. 2 overall pick of the 2007 NBA Draft started his career with the Seattle SuperSonics, made his name in Oklahoma City, and won two NBA championships with the Golden State Warriors' dynasty before bouncing to Brooklyn and Phoenix. To win his record fourth gold medal, Durant rejoined former Warriors teammate Steph Curry with Team USA in the 2024 Paris Olympics. “It’s great,” Durant told reporters, including talkSPORT, last month in London. “It’s exciting times.

his medal. REUTERS/Evelyn Hockstein Did Stephen Curry really make McDonald's France change their menu? What’s your take on this wild rumor? For over 15 years now, Stephen Curry has been an influential figure in American basketball. By winning four championship titles, setting himself as the All-Time Three-Pointer leader, and winning several accolades, he has become a household name domestically. The 2024 Paris Olympics gave him the opportunity to prove his worth on the international stage as well, as he led Team USA to his fifth consecutive Gold Medal. However, was his influence in the Olympics strong enough to consider bringing about a change in the menu of France’s McDonald’s? As it turns out, the answer is Yes. Although, it was not something that the player personally set out to do. In the aftermath of the Finals of the men’s basketball tournament between Team USA and France, the official Instagram handle of ‘McDonald’s France’ uploaded a post, carrying a picture of their Classic Curry sauce. As a joke, a caption was placed right on top of the sauce that read “pour des raisons evidentes, on songe a retirer cette sauce,” which literally translates to “for obvious reasons, we are considering removing this sauce.” Another caption was put on the side that stated, “Pour 4 ans minimum” (For at least 4 years). It wouldn’t have taken a genius to put two and two together to understand the context behind this post. Stephen Curry initially struggled to make a mark during the Paris Olympics. He blamed it on the FIBA rules and standards that were quite different from the ones established by the NBA. However, he boldly put his ultimate prowess on display during the Semi-Finals against Serbia, which Team USA was on the brink of losing. The 36-year-old repeated his actions during the final as well by securing a score of 24 points, 1 rebound, and 5 assists against France, as he went 8-13 with his field goals and 8-12 with his three-pointers. ADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad Four of those far-away shots were made in a consecutive manner within the final 3 minutes. By the time the Gold Medal was in his hand, the Golden State Warriors star had emerged as Team USA’s leading scorer, setting an Olympic record for the most three-pointers made in a final game. In light of this, the billion-dollar fast-food brand thought of cracking a joke at the expense of France’s loss. “This is a joke in reference to yesterday’s basketball game and Stephen Curry’s huge performance,” a spokesperson for McDonald’s France stated in an email to CNN.

Join Debate Do you think Dennis Rodman was a good father to Alexis? Yes No It's complicated Not sure Have an interesting take?  Join Debate Chef Curry saved Team USA from a loss against Serbia in the semis and was the most influential in the finals victory. Without him, the US basketball team might have had to walk away without a medal, and France might have finished on top. Therefore, by keeping the item on their menu, McDonald’s France may not have wanted to hand out a daily reminder to consumers about the man who cost them their Gold. However, if McDonald’s wants to take the joke further, they can allow the ‘Curry Sauce’ to make an appearance in US locations. With the 2028 Olympics set to take place in LA, fans would need it to remind them of the player who brought the previous medal home. Stephen Curry’s name and the name of the McDonald’s sauce are a simple coincidence. But thanks to their dominance on the NBA court, many basketball athletes have had some specific dishes named after them. Some have been bestowed this honor, while others have just created these food items by themselves. Carmelo Anthony entered the NBA in 2003 as part of one of the most promising draft classes of all time. Later on, he devoted the next 19 years of his life living up to that standard, securing his name in the NBA All-Star team on 10 occasions, winning four medals (three gold, one bronze) at the Olympics, and getting himself named to the NBA 75 anniversary team. However, amongst all these accolades, it would be remiss to not mention the sandwich that Carnegie Deli named especially in his honor. Introduced back in 2011, ‘The Melo’ is a monstrous food item. It is a skyscraper of meats, as it contains over 3.5 pounds of pastrami, salami, corned beef, bacon, and, to keep the sandwich a bit ‘healthy’, lettuce and tomato. Filling one stomach would also drain one’s wallet since, according to CBS News, ‘The Melo’ cost $21.95 when introduced. The reasoning behind the price was based on the fact that selling 3 million of ‘The Melo’ sandwiches would secure $65 million in sales, the same price that cost the New York Knicks in its extension deal with the player. During his stint with the Cleveland Cavaliers, Matthew Dellavedova created a reputation for being a player who would often engage in physical antics on the court. In fact, according to a poll conducted by The Los Angeles Times in 2016, he was ranked as the ‘NBA’s dirtiest player.’ Despite this, he had a thing not many of his peers did: A burger named after him. In May 2015, in order to celebrate National Burger Day and the Cavaliers securing a perfect 4-0 record during the Conference Finals, the Cleveland Cavaliers introduced ‘The Delly Burger.’ Being sold at a concession stand outside the basketball arena, the food item consisted of salami, capicola, provolone, gritty arugula, roasted peppers, and a tough texture of red wine vinaigrette. At $9.75, the burger might not have been that appealing to the eye but would have tasted different. In honor of #NationalBurgerDay & East Champs @cavs, our star #DELLYBURGER. @matthewdelly @TheQArena @AramarkSports pic.twitter.com/xTWWYvjk0J — Aramark Corporation (@Aramark) May 28, 2015 Expand Tweet  In 2015, then Charlotte Hornets small forward Michael Kidd-Gilchrist was honored with a burger bearing his name at The Cowfish Sushi Burger Bar, in Charlotte. The turkey burger consisted of a raclette, spinach, fried leeks, and a topping of hot pepper jelly. It will be rare for the NBA world to see a player like Shaquille O’Neal again on the basketball court. If there is one thing that longtime fans know about him, it is that the four-time NBA champion loves food. As a result, he set out to share his love by introducing not just one food item bearing his name, but a whole restaurant! Founded in 2018, the Big Chicken restaurant chain is Shaq’s brainchild. While it was only in 18 locations by June 2023, it is currently expanding at a rapid rate and will operate in over 300 stores soon. Specializing in Louisiana-style fried chicken sandwiches, many of the offerings are named after Shaq himself. Examples include the Shaq Attack, Shaq Daddy, Big Aristotle, Shaq Fu BBQ, and Superman. via Imago Credits: Big Chicken Shaq has also named several sandwiches to honor some of the closest people in his life. One of them includes Philadelphia 76ers legend, Shaq’s former rival, and his recent ‘Inside the NBA’ co-host Charles Barkley. After all, with an item named the ‘Charles Barkley Sandwich’, one would not have to guess hard. ADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad Before the era of Luka Doncic and Co, Dirk Nowitzki was the name Dallas Mavericks fans most resonated with. The player was honored with a dish named after him, ‘The Dirk Burger’. Created in collaboration with Nowitzki and AAC Executive Chef Mark Mabry and launched in 2016, it is a 1/3-pound hamburger placed on a Bavarian pretzel bun. The toppings included jalapeno beer cheese, arugula, bacon onion marmalade, and mustard horseradish aioli. Sold at the Mavericks’ home base of American Airlines Center, ‘The Dirk Burger’ made a re-appearance back in March 2017 in honor of Nowitzki’s quest for 30,000 career points.

York, NY United States – ZUMAp175 20220426_zsa_p175_001 Copyright: xMattxDaviesx Should Nike elevate Kobe Bryant's brand to the same legendary status as Michael Jordan's? The United States men’s basketball team clinched gold for the fifth consecutive time by defeating France on Saturday night in the 2024 Paris Olympics. Although busy with training for the Mike Tyson fight on November 15th, Jake Paul made time to watch Team USA succeed in the biggest games of the world. Meanwhile, he came up with the idea that the sports apparel brand Nike should sign more players to the Kobe Bryant brand. Such an idea is not a new thing Paul came up with alone—fans of the late NBA legend have made similar demands in the past. Jake Paul happens to be a more headline-friendly sort of person. It’s worth noting, that Nike’s Kobe brand, launched in 2005, is a line of basketball shoes and other merchandise created in collaboration with Bryant, one of the greatest NBA players of all time. It includes signature sneakers, apparel, and accessories. Regardless, Paul wants Nike to build a brand around Bryant like they did for Michael Jordan in 1997. All this transpired on social media, as Paul roped in Kobe’s wife Vanessa Bryant in the loop. ADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad While watching the Summer Olympics’ last basketball game, Paul hopped onto X and wrote, “Nike needs to sign players to the Kobe brand, just like Jordan. Seeing so many men and women ball players wearing Kobe’s at the Olympics. 8-10-24- let’s get that gold for Mamba.” He isn’t wrong. Many of the Olympic basketball players were sporting Bryant’s retro Nikes during many of the games. Is Jake Paul right to demand Nike treat Kobe's brand like Michael Jordan's? React! Reactions     A post shared by betr (@betr)  If that doesn’t convince you, here’s more: Even though Nike’s only released retro models so far, the Kobe line is still the most popular performance basketball shoe out there. And the good news? Nike’s already making moves in the right direction. They relaunched the ‘Kobe Brand’ last August, with more sneaker drops and ‘Mamba Programs’ in the NCAA. Still, Nike hasn’t fully created a Kobe brand like Jordan Brand just yet. Plus, if Nike does decide to, Kobe’s wife Vanessa Bryant should have the final say, according to Jake Paul. After Paul put his thoughts out there, he soon clarified his stance, adding, “Meant with full respect and admiration. Of course it’s Vanessa Bryant who has to make that decision.” The posts were then shared together by Paul’s sports betting app Betr’s Instagram page. Interestingly, when Jordan launched his sub-label in 1997, it included signing five NBA players, which later expanded into NFL and MLB. And this isn’t the first time Paul’s shown his love and respect for the late NBA legend. ADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad Back in January, Jake Paul opened up about the mix of emotions he felt during his professional boxing debut, which happened at a pretty tough time for sports fans. On January 26, 2020, the world was hit hard by the devastating news of NBA legend Kobe Bryant’s tragic death, along with his daughter Gigi and seven others, in a helicopter crash. As Paul was gearing up for his first pro fight that same week, he couldn’t help but feel the weight of the loss, especially since Kobe was admired worldwide for his ‘Mamba Mentality’ and unstoppable work ethic. My first pro debut’s fight week started on Jan 26, 2020. It was a very sad way to start my boxing career. Since then I’ve looked to learn from Kobe Bryant work ethic / Mamba mentality daily. Legends are forever. Rest in peace. pic.twitter.com/uBcYYVEHJP — Jake Paul (@jakepaul) January 26, 2024 Expand Tweet  ADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad In a touching post on X, Paul talked about how Bryant’s legacy has been a huge inspiration for him, shaping the way he approaches his boxing career. Even though that week was heavy with grief, Paul managed to push through and came out on top in his debut, defeating fellow YouTuber AnEsonGib with a first-round TKO. Looking back, Jake Paul paid tribute to Bryant, recognizing how much the basketball icon’s influence still drives him both in life and in the ring. Despite the lack of a complete brand around Kobe Bryant, every time Nike drops Bryant sneakers, the demand is difficult to keep up with. Meaning, it’s safe to say that it won’t be an unprofitable endeavor for Nike. Still, whether such a thing happens is yet to be seen. Would you like to see Nike sign players to the Kobe Brand?

After the final whistle at the Paris Olympics echoed through the city, most athletes sunk into much-needed rest. But for the dynamic father-son duo of Carmelo Anthony and Kiyan, the action was just heating up. Fresh off watching the basketball gold medal games in Paris, the 10× NBA All-Star and his son made a swift return to New York to catch another epic final—this time at Nike’s ‘NY vs NY’ tournament. A recent video shared by The Score on Instagram had fans buzzing. The caption read, “Druski was HYPED to meet Melo 🤣🤝,” capturing the excitement of American comedian and actor Druski as he greeted Carmelo Anthony at the event. The brief clip quickly went viral, showcasing the light-hearted moment between the two celebrities, with Druski clearly star-struck.   ADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad     A post shared by theScore (@thescore) Is Carmelo Anthony the ultimate basketball dad? React! Reactions  Although 3× Olympic gold medalist Melo was undoubtedly a significant presence at the event, it was Druski who stole the show as he crowned the champions of the court. The players from Dyckman emerged victorious against Uptown, clinching the title in a hard-fought battle. Nike’s ‘NY vs NY’ official page highlighted this moment with a video post, stating, “NEW CHAMPS HAVE BEEN CROWNED 👑 DYCKMAN CAPS A PHENOMENAL SEASON WITH A BIG WIN OVER UPTOWN. ONE STORY ENDS. ANOTHER ONE BEGINS. ✍” Of course, Melo wasn’t the only NBA personality to grace the tournament. Just days earlier, Nike celebrated hoops and sneaker culture at ‘NY vs NY’ with appearances from Memphis Grizzlies star Ja Morant. Earlier this year, other NBA stars like Ben Simmons, Tim Hardaway Jr., and Kyrie Irving also made an appearance at the tournament. Interestingly, while Carmelo was making his rounds, Kiyan was notably absent by his side—at least for a while. After an hour, the official ‘NY vs NY’ page on Instagram became active with a post that said: NO 1 NAME IN NYC IS REPPING BIG BROOKLYN 🍿🍿🍿 KIYAN IS IN THE BUILDING. But why Kiyan is the “No.1 name in NYC“? ADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad ESPN ranked Kiyan Anthony, son of NBA legend Carmelo Anthony and actress La La Anthony, as the top high school basketball recruit in New York State for the class of 2025. The young shooting guard is making waves, not just locally, but nationally, securing the 40th spot overall in his high school class. Moreover, Kiyan’s performances on the court are backing up the hype. According to Vibe.com, the rising star dropped 42 points in one game and 35 in another at the NBPA Top 100 Camp, showcasing his scoring prowess. His stellar play has caught the eye of top Division I programs, with schools like Indiana, Michigan, Florida State, and Syracuse extending offers. Interestingly, Syracuse, where his father famously won a national championship in 2003, seems to be a standout option. In 2023, Kiyan even made an official visit to Syracuse, posing in a jersey alongside his father, sparking rumors that he might follow in Melo’s footsteps. Though he hasn’t committed to any school yet, the idea of continuing his father’s legacy at Syracuse is generating plenty of excitement and speculation.

Pau Gasol,Team USA's Kobe Bryant forgot Pau Gasol was his Lakers teammate during 2008 Olympics and ran through him in true sign of 'Mamba Mentality',https://talksport.com/sport/1914025/team-usa-kobe-bryant-pau-gasol-lakers-olympics/,"Kobe Bryant was known around the world as 'The Black Mamba'. It was moniker inspired after the late, great Los Angeles Lakers legend watched Quentin Tarantino's 'Kill Bill' and needed something to separate himself from his on-court persona. In the film, the black mamba snake, known for its agility and aggressiveness, was used as a code name for a deadly assassin. It was nickname befitting of one of the most competitive players to ever suit up in the NBA. In 2008, Bryant and the rest of Team USA were looking for revenge. Four years prior, they'd been embarrassed at the Olympic Games in Athens, finishing with a bronze medal. 16 years earlier, the original 'Dream Team', led by Hall of Famers Michael Jordan, Charles Barkley, Larry Bird and Magic Johnson, destroyed everyone en route to Olympic gold and set the standard for all subsequent teams to aspire to. While the '04 team was no Dream Team, it was still a star-studded squad bursting with NBA talent, and a third place finish on the world stage was simply unforgivable. Team USA needed to salvage its global standing. It had to re-claim gold in 2008. Their solution?  Bring in reigning MVP Kobe Bryant, who had never played in the Olympics before but was seething after an NBA Finals defeat to bitter rivals Boston and was desperate to see the US reestablish themselves atop the international basketball food chain. 'The Redeem Team' had found its leader, one that could take a talented but inexperienced group including Carmelo Anthony, Dwyane Wade and LeBron James, and turn them into ruthless winners. Team USA headed to Beijing, China, in the summer of '08 as the overwhelming favourites, but reigning world champions Spain were still the team to beat. After blowout wins against China, Angola and Greece, Team USA faced Spain in a preliminary round game. Both teams were undefeated thus far (3-0), but one narrative in particular dominated the build up to the contest. Kobe vs Pau. Earlier that year, 7-footer Gasol had been traded to Los Angeles to play alongside Bryant and fill the Lakers' Shaq-sized hole that had been gaping for years. The big-man-little-man combo immediately hit it off, forming an potent partnership that saw them finish the season 27–9 and reach the NBA Finals. Ahead of the game vs Spain, Bryant told reporters that he and Gasol 'are like brothers' and that going against each other wouldn't be easy. ""I'm very happy for him that he's playing well,"" Bryant said. ""I mean, we're very, very tight, so it's a little tough to compete against him."" His locker room message was one of an entirely different tone. ""Kobe said he was gonna set the tone to start the game and he said, 'I'm running through Pau's chest',"" LeBron revealed in Netflix's Redeem Team documentary. James said the US players responded: ""Man, you tripping. That's your teammate. You tripping. You ain't about to do this."" ""First play of the game I'm running through Pau Gasol.' And we was like, 'What?'"" Dwyane Wade added.  ""He said, 'First play of the game, I know what they're gonna run.' And he knew Pau was gonna be the last screen and he said 'I'm running through him'."" Sure enough, Spain ran the play Bryant was expecting in the first few minutes of the contest. Gasol attempted to set a screen on Bryant, who ran straight through him at full force and knocked him over to the ground. Bryant was called for the foul and stood over his Lakers teammate as a bewildered Gasol looked around as if to check what had just happened. Kobe had sent a message, not just to Pau and Spain, but to his own teammates, without uttering a single word. ""He was like, 'No, he ain't my teammate right now. F**k him. Get up,'"" Carmelo Anthony said. ""I’m like, I love this energy. This is what we need right now."" ""He just went right into the middle of my chest, tried to get right through me to send a message,"" Gasol explained in the documentary. ""Not just to me, but to his teammates to say, 'Hey, this might be my brother. I play with him. We're close. But I don't care about anything else but winning.'"" ""We was like, 'Oh, ain't no way we're losing this game,” LeBron added. “We about to beat the sh*t out of Spain.” Team USA went on to cruise to a 37-point victory with Bryant finishing with 11 points in only 16 minutes of action. The United States and Spain met again in the gold medal game in what turned out to be a much closer affair. Kobe hit big shots down the stretch and finished with 20 points as the Redeem Team clinched a 118-107 victory. Bryant had set out what he achieved to do, winning gold for Team USA and avenging the humiliation of 2004. The way he'd done it, embodying his 'Mamba Mentality' -- 'attacking what's in front of you with passion and purpose, without fear and doubt' -- was what made it so special. Inadvertently, he'd also helped Gasol and the Lakers. ""I sincerely believed Pau benefited from the collision more than anyone else,"" Michael Lee of The Washington Post told Netflix.  ""He got to see how intensely Kobe approached the game and it helped him develop the mentality he was going to need to go back to back. ""The Lakers were going to be good, but they wouldn't be great by being happy-go-lucky."" The team from Tinseltown won consecutive titles with Bryant and Gasol leading the way, beating the Magic in 2009 and the Celtics in 2010. Bryant rejoined the national team for the 2012 Summer Olympics and won another gold meal, his second overall.  He finished his national team career with a record of 26–0 across three tournaments (including the USA FIBA Americas Championship), winning a gold medal each time. His international peak undoubtedly came in 2008 though, when the entire world saw what 'Mamba Mentality' was all about. For Gasol, that was as good as - if not better - than anything the original Dream Team ever did. ""Kobe came and they brought their A-Team,"" he said. ""I think that was probably as good or better than the potentially original dream team, if you ask me"". Gasol is one of the greatest international players in NBA history, winning two titles alongside Bryant. The Spanish big man was a six-time All-Star and NBA Rookie of the Year, He also has an illustrious international career having won a FIBA World Cup title, three EuroBasket titles, two Olympic silver medals, and an Olympic bronze medal.

Certainly, the basketball fraternity wouldn’t miss out on recognizing the feat and the talent. On August 10, in a game that kept everyone on the edge of their seats, the U.S. defeated Brazil 1-0.

Earlier this week, Trinity Rodman, Swanson, and Smith appeared on TODAY, where they proudly introduced their new moniker, ‘Triple Espresso.’ 5× NBA champion’s daughter explained, “We have a proposal for our trio name to be ‘Triple Espresso.’ So we’re going to put that out into the air and let people run with that, because we like that as well.” Although fans and players have also given the trio nicknames like “The Trident” and “Holy Trinity,” it’s clear that ‘Triple Espresso’ is the name that is sticking with them.

Goalkeeper Alyssa Naeher delivered a game-saving performance, especially with a one-handed save on Adriana’s header in stoppage time. This marked the third occasion where the U.S. emerged victorious against Brazil in an Olympic final, with previous wins in 2004 in Athens and 2008 in Beijing. Did Dennis Rodman's daughter just make her dad proud or what? React! Reactions Watching the moment live were Mission Impossible star Tom Cruise and former U.S. soccer star Megan Rapinoe herself. But celebrations were certainly not limited to courtside. As the US women’s soccer team secured only the 5th Olympic medal of the program, USA hype-man this Summer Games and Dennis Rodam’s brief rival, Magic Johnson, were quick to jump in to congratulate.“Congratulations to the US Women’s Soccer team on beating Brazil to win the gold this morning!!🥇” he wrote on X. Congratulations to the US Women’s Soccer team on beating Brazil to win the gold this morning!!🥇 — Earvin Magic Johnson (@MagicJohnson) August 10, 2024 Expand Tweet  Rodam, who shared the court with Kobe Bryant in 1999, also saw the LA Lakers‘ icon’s widow, Venessa, extending her cheers over the win – keeping alive not just the Kobe-Dennis bond but also the one he shared with his daughter. Posting an image of Trinity Rodman and her teammates on her Instagram story, she captioned, “GOLD.”  Kobe left a huge impact on Trinity when he reminded her that “women are capable of being as successful, if not more successful, than men.” She revealed that it motivated her to continue playing soccer. She had seemingly met Kobe through his daughter Natalia, whom she played on the same team with as a six-year-old. So the eldest of the Bryant daughters also celebrated the win, posting a photo of the ‘Triple Espresso’ trio with their gold medals.

She shared a stat graphic highlighting how the team has returned to its winning ways. Finally, back in the Rodman family, Trinity’s brother, Dennis Rodman Jr., who is following in his father’s footsteps by playing college basketball at USC, shared an image of Trinity and her teammates, captioning it, “Gold for you!! @trinity_rodman.” Trinity ended her Olympic run with three goals, one assist, and tallying 46 caps for the senior team.

Magic Johnson,"Dream Team’s Michael Jordan, Charles Barkley and Magic Johnson showed ultimate act of loyalty during ’92 Olympics with defiant act during gold medal ceremony",https://talksport.com/sport/1951106/michael-jordan-barkley-magic-dream-team-olympics-nike-reebok/,"Michael Jordan is Nike. Nike is Michael Jordan. The most marketable athlete in the history of North American sports has been intertwined with the venerated Swoosh brand ever since he put pen to paper on a five-year, $2.5-million endorsement deal in 1984. Mike and Nike's relationship eventually birthed the iconic 'Air Jordan' sneakers, a landmark shoe that became a major status symbol in footwear and streetwear culture around the globe. Nike's ascendancy from Oregon-based shoe brand to multi-billion dollar apparel corporation coincided with His Airness rising to the summit of The Association. By 1992, two-time champion and two-time Finals MVP Jordan had surpassed Magic Johnson and Larry Bird as the undisputed face of the NBA, and was about to take his talents overseas. NBA initially players weren't allowed to participate in the Olympics, but that all changed in 1989 when FIBA removed the rule. So, in 1992, Team USA head coach Chuck Daily assembled an Avengers-esqe squad bursting with NBA talent that was tasked with one simple goal: winning an Olympic gold medal. Jordan, Magic and Bird were joined by fellow Hall of Famers Charles Barkley, David Robinson, Karl Malone, and Patrick Ewing, among others, who descended on Barcelona, Spain with Beatles-like fanfare and with the mission of putting on a basketball clinic. The star-studded squad was aptly named the Dream Team because of their ethereal talents, and they predictably stomped on every team who dared to step in their way. The consensus greatest sports team ever assembled were unbeaten en route to the gold medal that summer, averaging more than 117 points per game and winning by an average margin of 44 points. Team USA defeated Croatia 117-85 in the gold medal game and Nike ambassador Jordan was suddenly faced with a difficult dilemma. Brand rival Reebok had secured exclusive rights to produce warm-up outfits and other apparel for American athletes, including Dream Team members, at the '92 Olympics. Reebok reportedly paid $4 million for the rights to Team USA’s medal stand jackets and the US Olympic Committee made it clear that winners had to accept medals while wearing jackets emblazoned with the Reebok logo. ""[They] said if we don’t wear our uniforms, we can’t accept our gold medal,” Jordan said at the time. But it wasn't just MJ's brand loyalties that were about to be tested. Of the 12 Dream Team members, none were Reebok endorsers, while six, including Jordan and Barkley, were Nike athletes. US co-captains Magic and Bird were longtime Converse advocates. Something had to give, and it was increasingly apparent that none of the players were about to jeopardize highly lucrative sponsorship deals by rocking a rival brand in front of millions of eyes. And so, as they went up to the podium to receive their gold medals, all 12 Dream Team players unzipped their jackets so that the collars obscured the Reebok sponsor patch. Jordan, the trailblazer that he is, went one step further. The Chicago Bulls legend covered the Reebok logo on the right shoulder by draping himself in the red, white and blue of the American flag. “They can’t hide it like I’m gonna hide it,"" Jordan said. ""They in for a big f***ing surprise."" Barkley and Magic were the only other players who followed suit and covered the Reebok insignia with the American flag. “Us Nike guys are loyal to Nike because they pay us a lot of money,” Sir Charles told reporters at the time. “I have 2 million reasons not to wear Reebok.” Jordan, Barkley, and Magic's defiant stance worked like a charm. There wasn't a Reebok patch in sight when The Star-Spangled Banner rang out around the Spanish arena. Straight after the medal ceremony had taken place, Jordan tossed the Reebok jacket to Brian McIntyre, a member of the NBA’s public relations squad, telling him he could have it. ""I certainly don't want it,"" he told McIntyre. McIntyre looked after the jacket - which has a patch that reads 'Reebok is proud to honor America’s finest' - for two years, thinking Jordan would eventually want it back. In 1994, McIntyre bumped into MJ at an event and tried to hand the item back to him. Instead, Jordan signed it: “To Brian, Thanks for Everything, Michael Jordan."" McIntyre kept the jacket for nearly 30 years. It remains a timeless piece of basketball memorabilia, and in 2023, sold through Sotheby's for $1.5 million. The jacket is so much more than 'just' a piece of memorabilia, though. It's an important artefact that serves as a powerful reminder of the enduring strength of brand Jordan and his unparalleled impact on sports, fashion and culture. “Everyone agreed we would not deface the Reebok on the award uniform,” Jordan said of the decision to cover up the jacket at the time. “The American flag cannot deface anything. That’s what we stand for. The American dream is standing up for what you believe in. I believed in it, and I stood up for it. If I offended anyone, that’s too bad. ""When you hire 12 Clint Eastwoods to come in here and do a job, don't ask them what bullets they're putting in the gun.""

Kyrie Irving,"Ex-Warrior Star Delves Into Why Tyrese Haliburton & Derrick White Fit Paris Olympics Squad Better Than Jaylen Brown, Kyrie Irving",https://www.essentiallysports.com/nba-active-basketball-news-ex-golden-state-warriors-star-delves-into-why-tyrese-haliburton-and-derrick-white-fit-paris-olympics-squad-better-than-jaylen-brown-kyrie-irving/,"More Sports ES Fancast Aug 8, 2024 | 2:08 AM EDT Derrick White over Kyrie Irving for the Olympics—smart move or a huge mistake? USA Basketball’s selection process for the 2024 Paris Olympics hasn’t pleased many. The community, in the last few weeks, has witnessed memorable moments, snubs, and big-time controversies, we tell you. Along with bringing back LeBron James after he last played in 2012, Steph Curry and Anthony Edwards also made it to the roster. The issue arose when Derrick White was sent as Kawhi’s replacement instead of Jaylen Brown. 2016 gold medallist Kyrie Irving was also excluded, with 8 years younger Tyrese Haliburton. Despite the uproar and Draymond criticizing his own GSW coach, another ex-Warrior believes that what happened was for the best. DeMarcus Cousins and Quinn Cook discussed Tyrese Haliburton’s inclusion in the Team USA roster. Quinn initiated the topic, stating, “You need a guy who’s not gonna be mad when not playing.” This was an indirect dig at Jaylen Brown, as the Team USA roster was reportedly concerned whether “someone of Jaylen Brown’s caliber would accept having a significantly reduced role.” Therefore, with the team filled with dominating scorers like LeBron, KD, etc, the need was for a player who wouldn’t mind staying on the sidelines. “Obviously, Jaylen Brown, Kyrie Irving, from a talent perspective, and what they’ve done, even with their resumes, they’re supposed to be on the team. But when you’re putting a team together, just sometimes you need your Derrick White,” Quinn Cook said on Above The Rim with DH 12. “The topic of the basketball world has been ‘Jayson Tatum not playing’, yeah. If Derrick White don’t play, that’s expected.” ADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad Being the second-in-command in their respective franchises, both Jaylen Brown and Kyrie Irving are expected to carry the offensive effort, which grants them more on-court minutes. During the NBA Finals between the Boston Celtics and the Dallas Mavericks, Brown averaged 38.5 minutes throughout five games, while Irving averaged 39 minutes. While Derrick White himself wasn’t that far behind with his average of 36.7 minutes, his scoring wasn’t on par with that of his Celtics teammate and Mavericks rival.

Join Debate via Reuters Paris 2024 Olympics – Team USA Basketball arrivals at USA House – Team USA House, Paris, France – August 05, 2024. Derrick White of United States arrives at the USA House. REUTERS/Tingshu Wang During the 2016 Rio Olympics, Kyrie Irving went on to average 22.2 minutes over 8 games, with 17 minutes being used up to add only 4 points in the Finals against Serbia. In contrast, LeBron James has averaged 20.5 minutes at the Paris Olympics, while Kevin Durant just 19.6. Therefore, Irving’s previous record of taking up a bulk of the minutes, which may or may not generate the required points, may have played a role in his exclusion. After Jaylen Brown hinted that his exclusion from Team USA was because of his sour relationship with Nike, the team’s managing director Grant Hill was quick to come out with a response. He went on to state that “the responsibility that I have is to put together a team and a team that complements each other.” He had to decide on these grounds, even if it meant not taking in “Finals MVP.” As highlighted by Quinn Cook, the management simply may not have believed that taking in Jaylen Brown and/or Kyrie Irving would have been worthwhile if they had just remained on the sidelines. Another ex-NBA player, however, had a stronger reasoning, siding with the Celt’s Nike agenda and providing more reasons for the same. Now that we’ve opened this can of worms, let’s dive deeper. After Jaylen Brown made headlines for blaming Nike, reactions started to pour in from all sides. Many former NBA players, including Gilbert Arenas and Rashad McCants, agreed with the Celtics star’s sentiment. During a segment of his ‘Gil’s Arena’ podcast, the Wizards legend even went on to state that Team USA was allegedly a Nike Event that just sidelined players who aren’t a part of the billion-dollar brand. McCants highlighted that both players were, at one point in time, associated with the brand until complications arose. “Jaylen Brown sided with Kyrie Irving. He spoke out against Nike dropping Kyrie,” said McCants. “Nike dropped Kyrie after the post, Jaylen Brown didn’t like that, I think he was the President of the Players’ Association at the time, he was obligated to speak out about what Nike did, why they did it, he didn’t like it. He was wearing Kobes at the time, so he started covering up his Kobes.” USA Today via Reuters Jun 6, 2024; Boston, Massachusetts, USA; Boston Celtics guard Jaylen Brown (7) looks on in the third quarter against the Dallas Mavericks during game one of the 2024 NBA Finals at TD Garden. Mandatory Credit: David Butler II-USA TODAY Sports Back in 2022, Kyrie Irving suffered from repercussions after he posted antisemitic content online. This involved the Nets suspending him, and Nike ending the endorsement deal that they signed with the player in 2014. By that point, it had been 3 years since Irving had left the Celtics, and much of the Boston fanbase had turned against the player. ADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad Despite this, Brown, in his capacity as VP of the NBA Players Association, stated his disagreement with the terms that Irving needed to fulfill for his franchise suspension to be revoked. When it came to Nike, Brown took to his official X account, and wrote, “Since when did Nike care about ethics?” This, according to reports, is what soured the relationship between Nike and the 2024 NBA champion. After Grant Hill went on to state that Brown blaming Nike was just a ‘conspiracy theory’, the Celt had to remind him that as VP of the NBA Players Association, he has “a great understanding” of how things work. Brown and Irving may have been excluded from the 2024 roster simply because of the playing minutes issue. However, no one can deny the ‘fishy-ness’ that this happened with the duo, who were not on good terms with Nike.

Blake Griffin,“Blake Griffin... Was Like a Monster”: Shaq’s Former Agent Says Michael Jordan Talk Not Anthony Edwards’ Biggest Concern,https://www.essentiallysports.com/nba-active-basketball-news-blake-griffin-was-like-a-monster-shaqs-former-agent-says-michael-jordan-talk-not-anthony-edwards-biggest-concern/,"More Sports ES Fancast Jun 14, 2024 | 9:15 AM EDT Anthony Edwards’ season ended in the Western Conference Finals, but by all accounts, he had a breakout year. And how! Comparisons to Michael Jordan started following him everywhere. It’s not about his stunning vertical, scary offensive maneuvers, or even trash talk. Charismatic confidence and the talent to back it up are very subtle Jordan-esque traits he displays. He’s played it humble on the MJ topic so far, but you can see him riding on it. Or at least social media can’t look past it. His Kobe Bryant-inspired Adidas campaign gave Jordan vibes to most, but is it taking away from Ant’s identity? Vishal Kolar asked Leonard Armato, the brand-builder to the pros like Shaq, just that on his second sit-down with EssentiallySports. It’s easy to throw out MJ comparisons but Kolar asked if this is damaging to Antman’s brand and his dreams to be the future face of the league. As per Armato, it’s a fine line. Armato: “I don’t think he has to take the bait on it. If people want to compare him to Michael Jordan, let ’em. All he has to do is say, ‘Jordan is one of a kind and I have ultimate respect for him.’ I think Anthony Edwards is sort of a different kind of guy, fun, young, certainly youthful in so many different aspects of his personality, explosive and incredibly fun to watch.” ADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad Edwards has the desire to be the face of the league. In all aspects, he’s getting there but it won’t be immediately. Jordan was a star before the championships but it was only when he led the Chicago Bulls to the Finals for the first time that national networks took the NBA as a prime-time commodity, expanded sponsorships, and even influenced fashion when it could be said that His Airness was the true face of the league. Before Edwards can get there, he has to be consistent and healthy. Armato: “It’ll be interesting to see how his career evolves. He hasn’t gotten to the promised land yet. He certainly is looking forward to getting there. I don’t know if it will be this year but if he perseveres, if he stays healthy, he could have an incredible career. But you don’t know, I mean look, people get injured at times, you never know. Look at Blake Griffin. The guy was like a monster, and then he had those injuries and really did debilitate him.” “There’s a lot of people who’ve suffered injuries, especially high flyers. And you’ve seen some of the things he’s done. It’s scary. I mean, he’s fallen on his back, blocking shots, and you’re wondering if he’s okay. So, let’s just see how this thing evolves. Certainly, he’s super fun to watch. He’s a charismatic kid. And, you know, underneath it all, he’s a bit in his show-off stuff, but at the same time, I think he’s got a good heart and he’s a good kid, and people really like him.” Armato is right that the ‘high flyers’ like Edwards are at high risk. He’s been severely prone to injuries, but when push comes to shove, he cannot sit down. He has to perform and lead his team. Edwards embraces the pain and plays through that, with the bravest of smiles. Hip injuries, twisting his ankle, fingers, and knees, anything and everything, yet he puts his best foot forward on the court. ADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad During Game 6 against the Denver Nuggets, Edwards had a scary fall on his back. They won Game 6 and assured fans he’d still play. The Wolves won the series in Game 7 and Armato was looking forward to the Conference Finals at the time of the interview, which they ended up losing. Even though Minnesota fans were disappointed by that defeat, fans still had a lot of fun watching him play. Armato elevates Edwards’ “good heart” which not enough people talk about. He’s engaging in an interview and not a braggart as he seems on court. AntMan initially accepted the MJ talk gracefully but in May, he flat out said, “I want it to stop.” He explained his reasoning. “He’s the greatest of all time. I can’t be compared to him.” ADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad Even the greatest aren’t immune, though. Michael Jordan was 22 during the infamous broken foot season in 1985. Edwards entered the NBA at 19 and is 22 now making veterans reminisce rookie Jordan. You don’t have to re-watch The Last Dance to know it wasn’t easy for Jordan to overcome that setback and very few have replicated such a comeback. The comparisons will be nothing unless Edwards maintains his physical condition and longevity.

Wesley Sneijder,The Man United transfer saga involving ex-Real Madrid ace Jose Mourinho loved who 'could have been as good as Lionel Messi',https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/transfer-news/manchester-united-sneijder-scholes-ferguson-27577462,"Manchester United have been embroiled in their fair share of transfer sagas. Even in his short time in the Old Trafford hot seat Erik ten Hag has encountered such issues, with his prolonged pursuit of Frenkie de Jong rarely far from the back pages but ultimately unsuccessful. Some other names have become almost running jokes among the fanbase as the Reds have been linked with them every time the transfer window opens. There was a time when Wesley Sneijder fell into that category. At the time, Paul Scholes was heading into the twilight of his career. The Class of '92 graduate was heading for a career break in 2011 before coming out of retirement in 2012 for 18 months. Sir Alex Ferguson knew a replacement would need to be brought to the club. ALSO READ: Ten Hag needs to solve a problem Ferguson admitted to having at United During this period, Sneijder was one of the most gifted and talked about midfielders in world football, evening once claiming he could have been as good as Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo. He had helped Jose Mourinho's Inter Milan win the Treble in the 2009/10 season before playing an important role in the Netherlands' run to the World Cup final. With United's need for a new central midfielder and Sneijder's reputation, it's no surprise that the Reds were linked with a move. In July 2011, the Daily Mail ran a story regarding the Dutchman which stated he had agreed a £35m transfer. A month later the move was off. But where does the truth lie regarding the Sneijder to United transfer saga? MEN Sport has taken a look. In the eyes of United's legendary manager, a deal for Sneijder was never on the table. During United's pre-season tour of the US in 2011, Ferguson told ESPN: ""I keep reading about this. There’s absolutely nothing at all to that."" The blunt response to a transfer rumour from Ferguson was no surprise. The boss never had time for gossip. Indeed, the Scot doubled down on his reply 10 years later. ""That's come up a lot of times but we were never interested in Sneijder,"" he explained. ""I don't know where that came from but you get a lot of them."" Sneijder has a very different recollection of United's reported interest in him. Shortly after joining Galatasaray in 2013, the midfielder opened up on the legendary manager having talks with his team. ""We had some talks with Alex Ferguson back in 2010,"" he told Galatasaray Dergisi. ""[United] contacted them [Inter] after our Treble season but too much money was asked for. And I was also happy at Inter so I decided to stay. ""Manchester United are a fantastic club and they kept showing interest after that year but not as determined as before. I don't give much thought about proposed transfers. If I'm happy somewhere, I'm happy there."" Fast forward to 2023 and Sneijder had passed the blame away from Inter and towards his own agent. “Well, actually, I was close in 2011,"" Sneijder told SPORTbible. ""I was close in 2011 after the Champions League and after the World Cup. But then, what I heard later is that because at a certain point, we were talking with United and at a certain point there was nothing anymore. United's Adidas home shirt is made up of the same colour of the city's iconic red rose and features a black collar. The collar also features a dash of both red and white, giving it a slick and modernised look. Prices start from £55 ""And I asked my manager, 'What happened with United?' And he said, 'No, nothing, it’s over'. But two years later, I found out that he asked for extra money for himself. So that's why the deal was over. So actually, Ferguson, he told one of my relatives."" As always with transfer speculation, the truth lies somewhere in the middle. Interest from United at the time does make sense, Sneijder fit the bill for what Ferguson would have wanted. However, it is also likely the deal never got close if Sneijder's agent was looking for a bigger cut than was being agreed. Ferguson was renowned for having little time for agents who were, for want of a better phrase, too big for their boots. If what Sneijder explained regarding his manager was true, it is unsurprising Ferguson never saw the midfielder as a solid addition to the squad. Like with many stars, the Dutchman's failed move is another 'what if' moment in United's storied history.

Damian Lillard,Damian Lillard & NBA World Fired Up After Kyrie Irving Honors Father Drederick’s Legacy With $29.98 Billion Company,https://www.essentiallysports.com/nba-active-basketball-news-damian-lillard-nba-world-fired-up-after-kyrie-irving-honors-father-dredericks-legacy-with-twenty-nine-billion-company/,"More Sports ES Fancast Jun 4, 2024 | 9:28 PM EDT Kyrie Irving won people’s hearts ahead of the NBA Finals. The Mavs star guard went through a rough patch in the last few years with controversies circling his head. These controversies eventually stripped away his Nike deal, and he was forced to play without a sponsor briefly. Until Irving signed a $120 million contract with Anta, a Chinese sports brand with a net worth of $29.98 billion! Infamously known as a troublemaker, he’s been on a good run lately. He doubled it down with a sweet gesture to his father, Drederick. Uncle Drew signed up his dad as the first Anta signature athlete. Following the honor, the hoops community swarmed in to appreciate the former NBA Champion. Notably, Damian Lillard took to his Instagram stories, shared the announcement, and wrote, “Fire.” The hoop nations’ famous shooting coach, Chris Matthews A. K. A Lethal Shooter, also expressed his appreciation. He wrote, “I love this. Genius.” Jared Dudley and Austin Rivers also joined the bandwagon and expressed their appreciation with a flurry of ‘fire’ emojis.     A post shared by Shams Charania (@shamsnba) ADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad  Kyrie Irving didn’t just sign up for any other usual deal but created history. Shams Charania, in his post, wrote, “This marks the first time in pro sports a player has signed his dad to a signature shoe deal.” The Mavs guard, who had signed a 5-year deal with Anta, also became the Chief Creative Officer of the brand. With that privilege, he has the power to recruit professional players, celebrities, influential figures, and artists into the company. The 8x All-Star took the opportunity to honor his father. Moreover, Drederick Irving isn’t new to the sport. The 58-year-old had played at Boston University before lacing up professional basketball in Australia. In the league of Jordans and LeBrons, Kyrie Irving’s signature line was a pretty big deal amongst the sneakerheads. Moreover, Nike was all set to launch The Kyrie 8 shoes before everything came crashing down. Irving turned into a public enemy No.1 in no time! In early 2022, the star guard shared a link to a documentary via his X handle, which was against the political beliefs of the league and Nike. ADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad Kai not only was suspended but also lost his deal with the global sports brand. On top of it, everyone turned their heads against him. After facing an 8-game suspension, Irving returned to the floor only after formally apologizing. But this time, he had to step without the Swish symbol on his sneaker. The star played without a deal for over a year with tapped-up shoes covering the Nike logo. On one fine day in 2023, Kai announced his association with the Chinese brand with a special post on his Instagram. The caption read, “This is truly a full circle moment that I will not take for granted nor underappreciated, given the many obstacles it took to get here.” Indeed, he didn’t take the deal for granted. He reached the NBA Finals and he’s made his dad a part of his success story too. What do you make of Irving’s journey following the Nike saga? Let us know in the comments.

Pelé,Freddy Adu was a Football Manager legend and had a following like Lionel Messi - I almost signed him for Billericay Town,https://talksport.com/football/1958901/freddy-adu-lionel-messi-jamie-ohara-billericay-town/,"Freddy Adu was once touted as the next Pele, he signed a $500k contract at the age of 14... then almost ended up in England's non-league. Football Manager fans will remember just how good Adu was and it was because of the popular game that fans anticipated a special talent on the horizon. In penning his contract at DC United, he became the highest paid MLS player - he was 14 - and the youngest-ever professional athlete in America. Nike were quickly onto this once in a generation talent. Two years later in 2006 he even earned a trial at Manchester United under the watchful eye of Sir Alex Ferguson. ""Freddy has done all right,” Ferguson said of the player, then 17. “He is a talented boy. He'll go back to the US and we'll keep a check on him. When he is 18, we will have to assess what we can do next.” But it turned out to be Adu’s only brush with English football, though not if talkSPORT’s Jamie O’Hara had his way. The former Tottenham midfielder was a former player and manager of the Isthmian League club and admits he was close to signing the player, who had the sort of cult following David Beckham enjoyed in America and which Lionel Messi is now used to. “I nearly signed him at Billericay but we couldn't get him a work permit,” O’Hara confessed on The Sports Bar. He’s still knocking about somewhere, he is still playing.” And what a coup that would have been for the Essex club despite never living up to the high expectation placed on him.  Now aged 35, Adu has been without a club since 2021 and despite never officially retiring from the game he now spends his time coaching kids. Adu enjoyed spells in the United States, Brazil, France, Portugal, Turkey, Serbia, Finland and most recently Sweden. He did play for big teams in Europe, though, like Benfica where he played alongside Angel Di Maria, and Monaco, but says this was a turning point in him becoming a so-called journeyman. ""The one decision I made that I would done differently is when I left Benfica after one year and went on loan to Monaco [in 2008],"" he told CBS Sports. That started the snowball of me having to go on loan from team to team because I wasn't patient enough at Benfica."" As well as acknowledging he could have been more dedicated to becoming the best, Adu cited Di Maria as someone who did remain patient in Portugal. ""A new coach came in, he played and next thing you know he goes to Real Madrid,"" he recalled. ""I go to Monaco and there was a power struggle between coach [Ricardo Gomes] and president - he wanted me really bad but the coach didn't feel like I was ready."" Things may not have gone the way Adu had envisaged for his career but he will be forever cherished as a Football Manager legend. Despite his worldwide acclaim on the game, Adu previously admitted he received barrages of messages from fans. ""I get a lot of tweets with people calling me a Football Manager legend and I'm like 'damn, I wish it was like that in real life'"" he joked in an interview in 2014. ""I haven't played that game, but I have a lot of friends that have and they've told me about it, so that's pretty cool.""

The Memphis Grizzlies and all their fans are eagerly waiting for the 2024-25 season to start. With a slew of unfortunate incidents to their franchise superstar and other key players, the Grizzlies could never catch a break.

In the meantime, Morant has no plans of leaving his fans stranded as the photos of his latest kicks have taken the internet by storm. The Nike JA 2 “Stargazer” truly does justice to the name. As opposed to his low-top JA 1, the latest shoes feature a higher cut. In addition, the ripple effect detail around the ‘swoosh’ tends to naturally draw the customer’s eyes to the vibrant purple colorway. Couple that with the rumored $120 price point, it’s sure to sell like hotcakes. “Thoughts on Ja Morant’s new shoe? 🤔 Ja Morant’s upcoming Nike Ja 2 has recently surfaced online in a “Stargazer” colorway 👾 @nicekickshoops. The pair is rumored to be releasing in October for $120,” Nicekicks posted on Instagram. ADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad     A post shared by Nice Kicks (@nicekicks)  The Nike JA 1 officially hit the markets in early 2023. Almost a 1.5-year gap certainly makes sense, given the year Morant’s had. Hence, this news comes like a breath of fresh air. However, Coach Taylor Jenkins provided a health update on Ja Morant just a few days earlier. During a recent Summer League broadcast, Jenkins confirmed that Ja was indeed cleared for full basketball activities. “Ja, it’s go time. So very encouraged, medically cleared, full go, crossed all the hurdles. He’s been phenomenal with his rehab. Now it’s full go basketball with him with all the contact. Now it’s been more on the body, getting that back in the right spot. But now he’s full go basketball-wise. We can dive into his basketball plan,” he said. From his 25-game suspension for brandishing a gun to the labrum tear during practice, the season had effectively ended for the 24-year-old. Memphis had seen a steady rise in their rankings in the nine games Morant played in between. Unfortunately, that was it as the Grizzlies finished 13th in the West. But as mentioned above, fans can’t help but be excited to see their young franchise star out on the court. Even so, there are still a few unhappy fans on Instagram who look none-too-pleased with his “Stargazer”. Straight off the bat, this fan put forward a serious argument. “Nike design team and creativity need to have a meeting because seriously this shoe looks like a LeBron mixed with a Kobe lol…” In all honesty, glimpses of probably LeBron XXI and maybe Kobe 5 can be seen. This next fan had one more name to add to the list. “Kobes+Lebrons+Sabrina 2s = Ja 2.” A simple, straightforward equation, which unfortunately once again hits the mark. There’s no denying that the details from these three iconic kicks can be found in JA 2. The prominent swoosh and distinct patterns, not to mention the alluring purple colorway, do not help Nike’s case in the least. In fact, another user has come up with quite a theory for such similarities. “All the Kobe & Kyrie model that got scrapped getting revamped.” We don’t have to tell you the aftermath of Nike terminating their contract with Dallas star guard, Kyrie Irving for his antisemitic comments. So, that subtle dig was also included here. ADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad Andrew Dutton, a sneaker photographer, voiced a complaint that many annoyed fans of the global apparel brand would relate to. “Nothing original coming from Nike basketball rn.” However, this last comment from an individual might leave the Nike PR team confused as to whether it was complimentary or insulting. Or at just the fine line between the two. “How different are y’all expecting a shoe? It’s 20 something Lebron’s and 12 Kobe’s. And y’all expecting a whole new silhouette and design we’ve never seen? Do the shoes look nice or not?” Well … we’ll leave that to you to decide. Do share your insights in the comments.

Steve Nash,List of top 5 Canadian players of all time,https://www.thestar.com/sports/doug-smiths-sports-blog/raptors-mailbag-my-list-of-top-five-canadian-players-of-all-time/article_3be2be42-361e-11ef-9bba-631e3e9dfb20.html," Based on the author’s interpretations and judgments of facts, data and events. With Canada Day weekend upon us, a readers asks who we think are the greatest Canadian basketball players ever. With Canada Day weekend upon us, a readers asks who we think are the greatest Canadian basketball players ever. Canada’s Shai Gilgeous-Alexander drives around Argentina’s Facundo Campazzo at the FIBA Basketball World Cup 2023 Americas Qualifiers in Victoria in 2022. It’s a somewhat abbreviated Ye Olde Mailbag this week, I guess not enough happened and everyone’s getting ready for the Canada Day holiday, Enjoy it and I’m sure there’ll be tons to ask about next week after the NBA free agency period opens. Q: Hi Doug, Not sure what you are planning for the Canada Day weekend mailbag (I hope you personally get a LOT of loafing time in). But given the holiday, and the emergence of Canada as a country that produces a whole lot of really great basketball players, how about a top 5 list of the best Canadian basketball players ever? Happy Canada Day to you and yours. MSG A: That’s a tough one because it covers so many eras and playing styles. But without regard to position, I go with Steve Nash, Shai Gilgeous-Alexander, Jamal Murray, Leo Rautins and Jay Triano. I’m sure I’m missing an obvious one or two but it’s early in the morning as I type and I’ve only had coffee. Q: Hey Doug: Now that the draft is done, I assume you’re preparing for all kinds of drama during the coming free trade frenzy (or maybe no drama at all). Watching the draft, we were constantly told that team X “was on the board” and had five minutes to submit their choice. What happens if the team does not announce their selection within the allotted time? Do they forfeit their pick? There are 30 teams in the league, with 30 first-round picks but only 58 second-round picks. Why? Of the four draft picks the Raptors selected, do you expect all four to spend the whole year in Mississauga? While no one today knows how they will develop over the coming months, which one(s) do you think are likely to spend some considerable time with the Raptors? Philip U A: I ended up typing short stories on my phone while a passenger to a family wedding Friday night and that wasn’t even before free agency starts. This has already been busy. Yes, if teams blow the time allotment the pick is forfeited but I can’t recall it ever happening and I’m sure there’d be a 20-second warning issued to each team close to the deadline. Two teams — Phoenix and Philadelphia — lost their second-round picks as part of penalties for free agency misfeasance last summer. I fully expect Ja’Kobe Walter and Jonathan Mogbo to be with the Raptors for the entire season. Maybe a game or two in the G League but that’s about it. Jamal Shead and Ulrich Chomche will see some G League action, I bet. Q: A bit late, but I wanted to flag your insightful Insider piece about the complicated personnel decisions re: Pascal Siakam and OG Anunoby. I’m as guilty as anyone in ascribing this purely to finances, so thanks for the deeper perspective. With 5,000 other Victorians, I avoided the NBA draft thanks to the senior women’s national team and Portugal. With a 12-person Olympic roster, there are some excellent Canadian players who will not be going to Paris (perhaps a couple of remarkable teenagers will be deemed too youthful). It was fun to watch coach Victor Lapeña experiment with lineups and tactics (a power forward seemed to have a brief stint at point guard). Not in Victoria was someone who will assuredly be going, Bridget Carleton who, as they say, has “taken a leap” in her fifth professional season, best exemplified by her monster performance earlier this week in something called the Commissioner’s Cup. Perhaps she is more confident or her team is much better, or both, but she is having a terrific WNBA season. Dare I say that the patient rebuild of the Minnesota Lynx supplies as good a model as any for the Raptors in the next few years? James A., Victoria A: I didn’t see the game thanks to the NBA draft but I heard they looked good — Portugal’s not exactly a global power, though — and there was some experimenting going on. Makes sense, too, to find who can do what. The full team — 12 players and alternates — is being announced Tuesday. It will include the four WNBAers, I’m told and eight you saw in Victoria. Q: Hi Doug, No NBA games, no NBA news right? Ok, not entirely true! I’m sure there are lots of questions about all the new Raptors additions, so I won’t add to the pile, but I did want to ask a few other questions: 1) Last week you briefly mentioned that Dalano Banton, as a member of the Celtics team, for the majority of the season would be eligible for a championship ring. Does that mean some former Raptors in a similar situation have rings? (Delon Wright? CJ Miles? Anyone else?) Did Jonas Valanciunas’s injury mean he didn’t play enough games to qualify? 2) Read a great article echoing a point that you made about Zack Edey and many other drafted players; critics focus too much on the negatives and forget about the positive qualities of the player. As a result, like the 2013 draft, this one was labelled as “weak” because of no clear frontrunners. Rudy Gobert can’t play offence, Giannis Antetokounmpo is too raw, neither Jalen Brunson or Nikola Jokic are elite athletes etc ... Fair assessments, to a degree, but missed the big picture. Thoughts? 3) Do you have any idea how early NBA scouts start paying attention to players? Obviously NCAA, and prestigious high school tournaments ... but beyond that? (The odd news stories about seven-foot tall sixth graders etc?) Thanks for all the pre-draft articles! I love Summer League, one of the earliest indicators of how well teams really drafted! Bernie M A: Teams can decide what they want to do to honour or include in celebrations anyone on the roster at any point in the championship. The Raptors did not give rings to Valanciunas, Wright or Miles, which I understand is the norm. I admit I wasn’t sure Edey was an NBA player at the start of the season, seeing him at the combine live and talking to people with teams that worked him out, I became convinced he was. Teams start putting together dossiers on kids in the mid-teens through such things as the McDonald’s all-star game, the Nike world event and various big-ticket AAU tournaments. Q: Do you have a list of names that we will probably see playing in the Summer League games for the Raptors? You mentioned in this forum a couple of months ago that Grady Dick was a probable, still true? Paul M A: I’m typing this early Saturday morning before heading home from a wedding and haven’t got the full roster. I wouldn’t be surprised if we have it by the time you read this Sunday. I don’t know about Dick but my guess is he’d be in Vegas to workout with the group but not play in games. Q: Hi Doug, Do you know if the Raptors made an attempt to trade for Josh Giddey? He’s still so very young and I imagine he spends all summer working on his jump shot. (He better be working on his jump shot all summer long!) Richard F A: I am not 100 per cent sure but I be shocked if they even made a call. They were always going to pay Immanuel Quickley as the starter and Giddey would probably be an expensive backup. Plus, I’m in the category of not entirely sure about how good he is. Doug

Colin Kaepernick,"Eight years on, Colin Kaepernick waits for NFL call: 'I could help win a Championship'",https://www.skysports.com/nfl/news/12118/13195418/eight-years-on-colin-kaepernick-waits-for-nfl-call-i-could-help-win-a-championship,"

 Colin Kaepernick believes he could still help a side win a championship in the NFL; it has been eight years since he last played; he helped the San Francisco 49ers to their first Super Bowl since 1994 but has not competed since 2016 
          Reporting from Paris
       Monday 12 August 2024 19:13, UK Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  Former NFL quarterback Colin Kaepernick believes he could help a franchise win a championship if he played in the sport again, despite an eight-year absence. Kaepernick spent six years with the San Francisco 49ers, helping them to their first Super Bowl since 1994 during the 2012 season, but has not competed in the NFL since 2016. ""We're still training, still pushing,"" Kaepernick told Sky Sports News. ""So hopefully. We've just got to get one of these team owners to open up. ""It's something I've trained my whole life for, so to be able to step back on the field, I think that would be a major moment, a major accomplishment for me. I think I could bring a lot to a team and help them win a championship."" In August 2016 and during his final season with the San Francisco 49ers, Kaepernick began kneeling during the pre-game national anthem in the NFL to protest racial injustice and police brutality. 'Taking a knee' made headlines globally and still happens in sports all over the world, including before certain matches during the Premier League and WSL seasons. At the time, two days after pledging to donate $1m to community organisations, Kaepernick said: ""The message is that we have a lot of issues in this country that we need to deal with.

              How Kaepernick first started taking a knee
             ""We have a lot of people that are oppressed. We have a lot of people that aren't treated equally, that aren't given equal opportunities,"" Kaepernick said speaking at Nike's 'Art of Victory' exhibition in partnership with the Pompidou Centre at the Olympic Games. Kaepernick said he would continue to kneel ""until justice is served"". The protests spread across the NFL in September 2016, and during the first week of the season, 11 players from the west to east coast protested. Taking a knee also began happening in the NWSL, with World-Cup winning footballer Megan Rapinoe kneeling during a national anthem in September 2016 and saying ""we need to have a more thoughtful, two-sided conversation about racial issues in this country"". The then US-president, Barack Obama, also spoke about Kaepernick's actions, and said: ""He's exercising his constitutional right to make a statement. I think there are a lot of ways you can do it when it comes to the flag and national anthem."" The NFL reports that more than 20 million people are currently playing flag football across 100 countries, with the five-versus-five version of American football a non-contact sport that is played by people of all ages. The next Olympic Games take place in Los Angeles in 2028 and flag football is one of the sports set to be introduced for the first time, something Kaepernick would love to be a part of. ""Hopefully we'll be out there,"" he said. ""We're going to work out some things, see if we can make it in there. Would love to be out there."" At the Paris Olympics, Kaepernick watched USA fight back from a 13-point deficit against Serbia in the semi-finals of the men's basketball and said it was a ""phenomenal game to be able to be at"". The USA won their fifth consecutive Olympic gold medal in a thrilling game against hosts France on Saturday, who they beat 98-87, with Lebron James scoring 14 points as he won his fourth Olympic medal and third gold. Steph Curry led the way to the win, scoring 24, while Devin Booker and Kevin Durant - the first four-time men's gold medallist in Olympic basketball history - scored 15 each. ""Hopefully they [Team USA] continue to build on their legacy but we have some of the all-time greats on this team,"" he said. ""You have a lot of players who are more on the tail-end of their career, but also performing at levels that we just haven't seen players do at their ages. ""When you get to see competitors who compete against each other their whole career get to team up and actually play together, so to be able to see the dynamic of Lebron, Steph, KD [Kevin Durant], Joel [Embiid], Taytum, D Booker, they've got the full squad out there. ""They're all All-Stars and for me I think about how you even put a team together, like, these are the five that are at any given moment. I don't want to be the one making that decision because everybody's so talented."" Kaepernick was in Paris running the 10km in the Marathon for All in partnership with Nike, along with Olympic champions Caster Semenya and Mo Farah. The event allowed amateurs to tackle the Olympic marathon course the night between the men's and women's races.

Shannon Sharpe,Devin Booker’s Surprising Take on Noah Lyles Provokes ESPN’s Shannon Sharpe: “You Ain’t Winning”,https://www.essentiallysports.com/us-sports-news-olympics-news-track-and-field-news-nba-basketball-news-devin-bookers-surprising-take-on-noah-lyles-provokes-espns-shannon-sharpe-you-aint-winning/,"More Sports ES Fancast Aug 6, 2024 | 9:59 PM EDT via Imago Image Credits : Imago via Imago Image Credits : Imago Noah Lyles won 100m Olympic gold, crossing the finish line five thousandth of a second ahead of Kishane Thompson. His historic win reignited the argument between track and field and NBA fans. However, Tokyo 2020 basketball gold medalist, Devin Booker, also chimed in ahead of the USA vs. Brazil match. The Olympian said he “still doesn’t see eye to eye,” with Lyles on his “World champions of what?” comment about the NBA. “I feel like all the best talent in the world is in the NBA. And that’s coming from an Olympic gold medalist who believes that being an NBA champion was probably harder to do,” argued Booker. However, the 4x NBA all-star’s comments didn’t land with Shannon Sharpe. “Devin! It was a moot point. I was dead, we had put this to bead. Why are you digging it up?” the nearly livid 56-year-old asked. Sharpe also disagreed with the Phoenix Suns player. “It is not harder,” countered Sharpe. “You know why? Because you can play (basketball), you cannot run,” with a leg injury implied Sharpe. “If anything below your waist bothers you. You ain’t winning,” in track and field events, said Shannon Sharpe in the latest episode of Nightcap on YouTube. ADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad ADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad Poll 1 of 4  Do you agree with Devin Booker's surprising take on Noah Lyles? Absolutely Not at all Somewhat I need more context What excites you the most about Pallas Kunaiyi-Akpanah's journey to the Paris Olympics? Her Nigerian roots Her college basketball career Her WNBA experience Her potential impact on the Olympics Do you think Carl Lewis' comments about the Paris Olympics are justified? Absolutely Not at all Somewhat No opinion Do you think Nike's move to use Deion Sanders to reconcile with Kevin Durant was genuine? Yes, it's a smart PR move No, it's just damage control Maybe, time will tell Who cares, it's all about the money However, the retired NFL tight end also had a solid argument while defining Noah Lyles and track and field. The ESPN analyst argued everyone how people have seen basket ballers “tape things up,” like injured toes, (feet) arches, and Achilles, and play to win. Sharpe also named players such as Rajon Rondo, who continued to pay with a dislocated elbow. In fact, the former footballer didn’t even shy away from giving examples from his own sport. “We saw The Rams’ Jack Youngblood, play with a broken leg,” said Sharpe. Finally, after sufficiently substantiating his argument, Sharpe asked Devin Booker which track and field event the NBA star believed could be played with a broken leg. However, Shannon Sharpe and Devin Booker aren’t the only ones talking about what Noah Lyles said last year. ADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad “World Champion of what? The United States?” is all it took for the 27-year-old track icon to spark a debate that refuses to die down. However, the real reason behind the debate catching a second wind is because of Lyles’ historic 100m Olympic medal. Immediately after Lyles backed up his tall claims, social media filled with comments like “Noah Lyles just murdered all of NBA Twitter.” Now, the athletes and experts are once again going back and forth on every platform. DeMarcus Cousins echoed the words of Devin Booker in the August 6th episode of the Above The Rim with DH 12 podcast. The Rio 2016 basketball champion also argued that the NBA winners deserved the World Champion title, as those teams often consist of the best players from across the world. However, with Lyles eyeing another gold medal in the 200m sprint, it seems this debate won’t be ending anytime soon.

Johnny Manziel,Johnny Manziel Playfully Crowns Michael Vick as the GOAT Quarterback Trumping Tom Brady and Patrick Mahomes,https://www.essentiallysports.com/nfl-legends-news-johnny-manziel-names-michael-vick-as-the-goat-quarterback-trumping-tom-brady-and-patrick-mahomes/,"More Sports ES Fancast Mar 21, 2024 | 8:05 AM EDT via Imago Credits: Imago via Imago Credits: Imago 2012 Heisman Trophy winner Johnny Manziel showcased his funny bone by dropping a bizarre opinion on the NFL GOAT debate. Manziel recently appeared on the ‘Run It Back‘ on FanDuel TV LIVE with co-hosts Michelle Beadle, Shams Charania, Lou Williams, and Chandler Parsons. When asked who he thinks the GOAT is, Manziel’s answer left everyone stunned. Instead of picking from popular choices like Tom Brady and Patrick Mahomes, he name-dropped former Atalanta Falcons legend Micheal Vick. Vick was a Heisman Trophy winner like Manziel in 1999 and was considered a dual-threat quarterback. During the interview, Manziel jokingly backed his belief that Micheal Vick, known for his electrifying playing style and unparalleled athleticism, deserves the title of the GOAT title. “I love Michael Vick,” Manziel stated emphatically. “I’ve been a Vick guy my whole life. What he did on the field was just different. His running style, his playmaking ability – it changed the game.” ADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad However, he later repealed his choice, and supported Tom Brady’s bid on the title, emphasizing, “Mahomes is the guy right now; everybody’s got to knock him off,” Manziel explained. “But how can you not love Vick? He’s a game-changer. You have to win six, seven Super Bowls to beat Brady. Vick changed the game.” Some fans argued in the comments that Vick’s career remained unfulfilled due to the lack of silverware. It sustained success, much like that of Brady and Mahomes. However, despite not being serious with his answers, Manziel’s take does offer a new perspective into how the best should be considered. ADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad Manziel explained Vick’s impact on the game. He underlined how Vick helped change how the position is looked at and formulated into a modern-day quarterback. “Vick is blazing his path,” Manziel defended, “His thousand-yard receiving seasons, only Randy Moss comes close. He’s a first-ballot Hall of Famer.” Known by his fans by the moniker “Ookie“, Vick was the first quarterback to rush for 1,000 yards in a single season, showcasing his unique skill set. He was selected for four Pro Bowls and won the NFL Comeback Player of the Year award in 2010. ADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad His innovative approach to quarterbacking paved the way for future generations of dual-threat quarterbacks. Do you think Manziel’s comments backing Micheal Vick are fair if we only consider comparing quarterbacks based on individual abilities? Let us know in the comments below.

The warning signs led shares to close 20% lower on Friday -- making it the worst trading day in the company's history since its IPO in Dec. 1980. The plunge wiped about $28 billion off of Nike's market cap, bringing it to just under $114 billion from $142 billion a day earlier.  As Wall Street digested the dismal outlook from the world's largest sportswear company, at least six investment banks downgraded Nike's stock. Analysts at Morgan Stanley and Stifel took it a step further, specifically calling the company's management into question. ""The FY25 guide (the 5th downward consensus revision in 6 quarters), pushes prospects for growth inflection further into 2025 (perhaps FY4Q or spring '25 at the earliest) asking investors to both underwrite success of not yet proven styles and look across an uncertain consumer discretionary backdrop into 2HCY24 until momentum could build again into 2HCY25,"" wrote Stifel analyst Jim Duffy. ""Management credibility is severely challenged and potential for C-level regime change adds further uncertainty."" Since Donahoe took over as Nike's top executive, its stock is down more than 25% as of Friday's close, significantly underperforming both the S&P 500 and the XRT – the retail-focused ETF – which saw gains of around 67% and 66% in that time period, respectively. Nike finance chief Matt Friend on Thursday attributed the guidance cut to a host of factors. Some, like softness in China and challenging foreign exchange headwinds, are outside of Nike's control, but others are problems it squarely created under Donahoe's leadership.  The company is expecting wholesale orders to be slow as it scales new styles, pulls back on classic franchises and works to repair its relationships with key retail partners after spending the last few years cutting them off in favor of a direct-selling strategy.  At the same time, loyal customers who shop on Nike's website are no longer springing for new pairs of Air Force 1s, Air Jordan 1s or Dunks, the company's core franchises. Critics say the sneaker lines have dominated the retailer's offerings for too long and turned customers away as they sought fresh styles and innovative designs from a slew of upstart competitors.  That's left Nike to win back some of its most essential customers – runners. As the retailer focused on its direct-selling strategy at the expense of innovation, scrappy competitors like On Running and Hoka snatched up market share. ""It was almost silly towards the end of the call they talked about running being such a key sport that consumers are taking part in. … We've known that for a long time, we've known that the consumer changed their mind post-pandemic, how they're much more active,"" Jessica Ramírez, senior research analyst at Jane Hali & Associates, told CNBC, adding a management change at Nike is ""quite needed.""  ""Post-lockdown, we saw that the consumer did adopt running and was serious about that and there was an everyday runner, and Nike didn't really respond to that,"" she said. ""I think when you have management missing key consumer shifts, there's a problem with your company … something changed and they've missed the mark."" Kevin McCarthy, a senior research analyst at Neuberger Berman, told CNBC's Scott Wapner on Thursday that the company needs a change in management and speculated that Donahoe's employment contract could soon expire.  ""Everything that you've suggested is wrong with this company seems to flow back to execution, management and everything else,"" McCarthy said on CNBC's ""Closing Bell."" ""They've got a couple internal candidates right now that are very capable … you've got a couple ex-Nike candidates, too, that have been in the discussion, and then you also have other competitors that have been discussed. But I do think that it's assumed that the leadership of this company will be changing over the next six months.""  In fairness to Donahoe, the Covid-19 pandemic started in earnest in the U.S. less than two months into his tenure, and he's had to grapple with shuttered stores, remote workers and a roller-coaster ride of shifting consumer preferences and abilities.  While the company's stock may be down, Nike's annual sales have grown some 37% under his leadership from $37.4 billion in fiscal 2020 to $51.36 billion in fiscal 2024.  If you ask Phil Knight, Nike's founder and its chairman emeritus, Donahoe is doing just fine.  ""I have seen Nike's plans for the future and wholeheartedly believe in them,"" the 86-year-old told CNBC in a statement. ""I am optimistic in Nike's future and John Donahoe has my unwavering confidence and full support."" Got a confidential news tip? We want to hear from you.

You’ve reached your account maximum for followed topics.                         
                    Unsurprisingly, the Los Angeles Lakers' search for a new head coach has been nothing short of captivating. 
    

    
                                JJ Redick
                    
                     leads a pool of candidates who could take the kingdom's keys.
    

    
                                 As the process of hiring a new head coach progresses, a recent report has shed light on what the future coaching staff could ultimately look like.
                         According to Dan Woike of the Los Angeles Times, the Lakers met with James Borrego on Wednesday and were pleased with the interview.
                         “Latest on the Lakers coaching search, Borrego interviewing (heard he was impressive) and possible assistant coach names that people have been talking about, some more likely than others.""
                          Although Los Angeles is interviewing other candidates, it sounds like the head coaching job is Redick’s to lose at this point. With Redick still bound to ESPN through the duration of the 2024 NBA Playoffs, the hiring likely won’t happen until the Finals have concluded.
                         However, it appears that the Lakers have begun to think about potential additions to the coaching staff that include names like Scott Brooks and 2x NBA champion Rajon Rondo.
                         Via Los Angeles Times:
                         “Rumors of the Lakers’ staffing plans have run throughout the league during the past two weeks, with some names most commonly mentioned including former head coach Scott Brooks and assistants Sam Cassell and Jared Dudley, Woike wrote.” Ex-Lakers guard Rajon Rondo has also been under consideration, according to people with knowledge of the situation not authorized to speak publicly.”
                         Rondo began his career with the Boston Celtics in 2006. In the following season, he became a full-time starter as the Celtics defeated the Lakers in six games that June to win the world championship. In 2018, he signed with the Lakers, and in his second season with the team, he played a key role off the bench as it won it all.
      
                     For years, Rondo has been lauded by his peers for his high basketball IQ and strong feel for the game. Perhaps he could even make a decent head coach someday after he pays his dues as an assistant first.
      It’s been widely reported James will not be involved in the Lakers’ coaching probe. Given James’ history, that statement naturally draws skepticism.
                         In April, Rondo called it quits after 16 seasons in the NBA. The 6'1"" guard’s ability to push the pace, facilitate, attack the basket, and make timely plays was indispensable to L.A.’s 2020 championship squad. James certainly appreciated playing with him.
                         James spoke glowingly of his former teammate:
                         “One of the best players I ever played with. Obviously, his IQ was out of this world. I was very lucky to get to team up with him… ‘Do always talked about if he ever teamed up with me, he knew we could win a championship. And we did that."" - LeBron James
                         James would undoubtedly vouch for Rondo to join the Lakers coaching staff. No. 23 has often stated his affinity towards guys with a high basketball IQ. According to James, Rondo is one of the most brilliant basketball minds ever.
                         Without a doubt, the job of coaching James — as either the head coach or assistant – is extraordinarily challenging. Without a doubt, James' passive-aggressive nature can make a coach's job much harder than it needs to be. Without a doubt, James has some blood on his hands for the way Darvin Ham’s tenure went down.
                         For some, that will be enough to brand James with that ""coach killer"" moniker -- one of the most brutal insults you can give a professional athlete.
                         In light of this recent criticism, James perhaps decided he’d stay out of it altogether. However, it wouldn’t be a stunner if James spoke privately to Rondo about signing on to coach.
     Rich Paul, the agent of LeBron James, appeared to accidentally hint at James' future with the Lakers.

Credit: Kyle Terada-USA TODAY Sports Is Jaylen Brown's controversy a sign of deeper issues within the team? USA basketball’s managing director, Grant Hill, has been caught in a wave of controversies since the Olympics began. It started with Jaylen Brown‘s exclusion from the squad, and then Jayson Tatum not receiving enough playing time during the Olympic games. Even though Hill said that he would consider Brown in the 2028 Olympic squad, things have not cooled down yet. Team USA went to the Olympics with a star-studded lineup, which comprised 12 players top-tier NBA players. Yes, they won the gold, but it was not all sunshine and rainbows behind the scenes. With that much talent, not everyone got the minutes they wanted – even the big names from the NBA squads. Just look at Jayson Tatum-he ended up with multiple DNPs, as he sat out two whole games with no playing time and not everyone was happy with it. In light of that, veteran NBA analyst Brian Windhorst advised Grant Hill to pick the young players going ahead, to avoid all the drama. The idea is to start developing the young players specifically for FIBA competitions and to build a squad that is down to stick together through a few summers, leading up to big events like the 2028 Olympics. “I don’t necessarily think it’s the worst idea in the world to take all young guys to the World Cup. Like, do what they do in soccer of the Olympics and say, we are gonna take all 23 and under,” Windhorst mentioned on the ESPN podcast. ADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad “Because we[Team USA] are gonna start developing FIBA players. We are gonna say, ‘hey, commit to playing in the summer in 2026, commit to playing the summer in 27′ and you are not promised for 28’ but let’s see where it leads. Maybe there shouldn’t be, in spots 11 and 12, maybe there shouldn’t be star players there. Maybe there should be FIBA players, NBA players, don’t get me wrong, but FIBA players who have played for multiple summers in a row,” the media vet further added. Is Jaylen Brown's controversy a ticking time bomb for Team USA? React! Reactions Windhorst wants Team USA to create a crew that’s more in sync with international play. After all, it’s all about long-term growth and commitment, not just banking on NBA stars. Talking about NBA stars though, what’s been brewing between Grant Hill and Jaylen Brown? Let’s dive deep. It was not that long ago that Jaylen Brown took a shot at Team USA and Nike, letting everyone know he was not cool with Team USA picking his Celtics teammate, Derrick White, as Kawhi Leonard‘s replacement instead of him. The current finals MVP tweeted, “@nike this what we doing.” Brown was probably implying it was Nike that kept him off the Team USA roster. ADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad In response, Hill said, “And, so, whatever theories that might be out there, they’re just that. But that’s my responsibility. And it’s tough. It’s tough to have conversations, tell people that they’re not on the team.” Jaylen Brown did not take too kindly to being called a conspiracy theorist by the USAB managing director, as he shot back, stating, “Grant Hill calling me a conspiracy theorist is disappointing. I’ve been a VP [of the NBPA] since I was 21 years old, I have a great understanding.” However, Grant Hill now wants to squash the beef. He is even open to having Brown on the Team USA squad in the 2028 Olympics. “It’s a lot of noise. I’m confident he and I will sit down at some point and talk about it and get to some level of understanding. He’ll be a candidate, if he wants, in 2028. One thing I’ve learned, you can’t take anything personally in this role. I haven’t personalized anything. My objective, my goal, is to win. And as soon as, hopefully, that happens, we pivot and start looking ahead to the future,” Hill said. As this might have been the last season for many of the veteran players in the Olympics, there will probably be space for Jaylen Brown on the Team USA roster for the 2028 Olympics. But the question is, after all that has happened, will Brown accept the offer to be a part of Team USA? What are your thoughts?

Jayson Tatum,"Will Jayson Tatum Lead the Charge in 2028 Olympics? Steve Kerr Decision Could Make Team USA a Boston Celtics Powerhouse, Here's How",https://www.essentiallysports.com/nba-active-basketball-news-will-jayson-tatum-lead-the-charge-in-two-thousand-twenty-eight-olympics-steve-kerr-decision-could-make-team-usa-a-boston-celtics-powerhouse-here-s-how/,"More Sports ES Fancast Aug 11, 2024 | 7:57 PM EDT Can Jayson Tatum turn Team USA into a Celtics-dominated powerhouse in the 2028 Olympics? The announcement of the 2024 Olympics roster drew criticism from many. With the kind of talent available in the NBA and the no. of players willing to play, disagreements were more than bound to happen. But soon, another controversy pretty much rocked the Olympic boat. Steve Kerr, deciding not to play Jayson Tatum in the tournament opener, really ruffled serious feathers. But then again, taking a look at the whole Team USA campaign, Kerr has been at the receiving end of the short stick for his player combinations. Come 2028, when the next round of the Olympics rolls up, it seems like the USA Basketball board could very well turn into a Celtics powerhouse. For one, choosing Derrick White, over 2024 Finals MVP Jaylen Brown, after Kawhi Leonard withdrew his candidature, had put Managing Director Grant Hill in the spotlight—and not the good kind. At the time, Hill calmed the crowd with a promise. If Brown was willing, he’d have a place in the 2028 Olympic roster. And for all the Tatum fans, this new Evan Sidery update on X would also prove to be quite a relief. “Steve Kerr is likely to retire as Team USA head coach, which means a new lead voice for 2028 in Los Angeles. Erik Spoelstra is viewed as the strong internal favorite to become Team USA’s next in line following Gregg Popovich and Kerr.” ADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad Along with Kerr, LeBron James, Kevin Durant, and Stephen Curry – the three-headed hydra of Team USA- are also likely to be retiring. While it’s true that it’s a tough position to fill, it’s still vacant. And by 2028, there’s no doubt that JT, JB, and White would very well adorn the veteran badge. And if the 30-year-old is still a Celtic, Team USA would, in effect, be a ‘Celtics powerhouse’. Poll 1 of 4  Do you think Jayson Tatum can lead Team USA to Olympic gold in 2028?

And they went public with their criticism. The head coach, however, has played it diplomatic across the board and he delivered on the promise of bringing the Gold medal back home. Even though the critics couldn’t say much after that, as even Jayson was seen sharing a broad smile with his teammates, let’s dive deeper and see what his mother and franchise owner had to say earlier. It was only a matter of time before Brandy Cole would be forced to put her foot down. Her son just led his team to an NBA title in the wake of the best record in the league. He earned a spot on the All-NBA first team for 3 years straight and received All-Star recognition for 5 years! So yes, Mama Tatum was indignant. And she made sure to let Kerr know of it when she replied to a tweet from ESPN’s Dick Vitale. “Someone pls let me know is @jaytatum0 injured as he hasn’t received the PT ( playing time ) u would expect an All NBA player to get,” Vitale posted from his X account. Cole immediately took the chance to re-tweet with a dig of her own. “No he not. But if you find out what’s going on please let me know – unacceptable and makes NO SENSE.” If Kerr thought JT’s mom was the only one who had some words for him, think again. ADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad Kerr’s actions also stupefied Boston’s majority owner, Grousbeck. Appearing on the Greg Hill Show, recently, he said, “I mean, I wouldn’t play Steve Kerr. Let me put it that way… It’s a complete mystery. I think Jayson doesn’t deserve anything but praise, kudos and playing time. I think he and Jaylen [Brown] led us to this unbelievable championship and they’re not apparently helping the Olympic team. It’s mystifying.” Clearly, there are a lot of people who are unhappy with Steve Kerr. But even amid such disappointing circumstances, Jayson Tatum has his fill of happiness. The NBA championship, obviously. But the Tatum family welcomed another member. After the Team USA win, the 2x Olympian and his family posed for family portraits, and who else to join them, but Grammy winning-singer and Tatum’s baby mama, Ella Mai? Anyway, the 2028 Team USA roster is going to be very interesting. If not for anything else, to see if Grant Hill makes good on his word. What do you think?

Devin Booker,Devin Booker’s Surprising Take on Noah Lyles Provokes ESPN’s Shannon Sharpe: “You Ain’t Winning”,https://www.essentiallysports.com/us-sports-news-olympics-news-track-and-field-news-nba-basketball-news-devin-bookers-surprising-take-on-noah-lyles-provokes-espns-shannon-sharpe-you-aint-winning/,"More Sports ES Fancast Aug 6, 2024 | 9:59 PM EDT via Imago Image Credits : Imago via Imago Image Credits : Imago Noah Lyles won 100m Olympic gold, crossing the finish line five thousandth of a second ahead of Kishane Thompson. His historic win reignited the argument between track and field and NBA fans. However, Tokyo 2020 basketball gold medalist, Devin Booker, also chimed in ahead of the USA vs. Brazil match. The Olympian said he “still doesn’t see eye to eye,” with Lyles on his “World champions of what?” comment about the NBA. “I feel like all the best talent in the world is in the NBA. And that’s coming from an Olympic gold medalist who believes that being an NBA champion was probably harder to do,” argued Booker. However, the 4x NBA all-star’s comments didn’t land with Shannon Sharpe. “Devin! It was a moot point. I was dead, we had put this to bead. Why are you digging it up?” the nearly livid 56-year-old asked. Sharpe also disagreed with the Phoenix Suns player. “It is not harder,” countered Sharpe. “You know why? Because you can play (basketball), you cannot run,” with a leg injury implied Sharpe. “If anything below your waist bothers you. You ain’t winning,” in track and field events, said Shannon Sharpe in the latest episode of Nightcap on YouTube.

Yes, it's a smart PR move No, it's just damage control Maybe, time will tell Who cares, it's all about the money However, the retired NFL tight end also had a solid argument while defining Noah Lyles and track and field. The ESPN analyst argued everyone how people have seen basket ballers “tape things up,” like injured toes, (feet) arches, and Achilles, and play to win. Sharpe also named players such as Rajon Rondo, who continued to pay with a dislocated elbow. In fact, the former footballer didn’t even shy away from giving examples from his own sport. “We saw The Rams’ Jack Youngblood, play with a broken leg,” said Sharpe. Finally, after sufficiently substantiating his argument, Sharpe asked Devin Booker which track and field event the NBA star believed could be played with a broken leg. However, Shannon Sharpe and Devin Booker aren’t the only ones talking about what Noah Lyles said last year. ADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad “World Champion of what? The United States?” is all it took for the 27-year-old track icon to spark a debate that refuses to die down. However, the real reason behind the debate catching a second wind is because of Lyles’ historic 100m Olympic medal. Immediately after Lyles backed up his tall claims, social media filled with comments like “Noah Lyles just murdered all of NBA Twitter.” Now, the athletes and experts are once again going back and forth on every platform. DeMarcus Cousins echoed the words of Devin Booker in the August 6th episode of the Above The Rim with DH 12 podcast. The Rio 2016 basketball champion also argued that the NBA winners deserved the World Champion title, as those teams often consist of the best players from across the world. However, with Lyles eyeing another gold medal in the 200m sprint, it seems this debate won’t be ending anytime soon.

Caitlin Clark is changing the landscape of women’s basketball like no one before her. But unlike Steph, the 22-year-old is not bringing a revolution in how the game is played. WNBA’s latest #1 pick is rather redefining the financial heights for a female basketball player. Sports apparel juggernauts Nike, with a reported 8-year $28 million deal, as per WSJ, made Clark the biggest endorsement holder in women’s basketball. To put that in perspective, LeBron James, the face of the NBA struck a $90 million deal in 2003. The same year, Serena Williams took home $40 million, paving the way for female athletes around the globe. It took a basketball player 21 years to reach anywhere near that number and Clark still fell double-digit short of those numbers. But it is still a historic win for women’s basketball. How, you ask? Let’s deep dive right into it. Only 7 NBA players have signed a bigger rookie shoe endorsement deal than Caitlin Clark. ADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad Caitlin Clark overtook John Wall’s $25 million deal with Reebok to beat him and all NBA rookies in the game’s history with her latest incentive with Nike, which will get her over $3 million/year. That raises a question, how much will the ex-Iowa star make in WNBA? ADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad This is where the disparity still makes the NBA a different ball game altogether. Clark will make a mere $76,535 in her rookie year as a #1 pick in the WNBA. In an overall 4-year deal worth $338k, Spotrac claimed that her salary will increase year by year and she will take home $97,582 in the fourth year. Soon after she was drafted, the WNBA’s Commissioner, Cathy Engelbert revealed, “Caitlin has the ability to make up to a half of a million dollars just in WNBA wages this year, so they’re just looking at a base, which is collectively bargained and [what is reported is] actually is low, because she’s the No. 1 pick.” ADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad On the other hand in NBA, Victor Wembanyama and several other rookies before him made more than $10 million in their 1st year. Notably, the WNBA current players receive a revised salary after 2020 which is set under the current union collective bargaining agreement. However, there is a lot of catching up to do. But with Caitlin’s global recognition, good paydays are not too far for female athletes. And the WNBA already got a glimpse of her stardom after the former Hawkeye star reportedly pulled in 3.09 million viewers during her draft!

Patrice Evra,Manchester United squad were ‘ready to kill’ team-mate after Liverpool loss,https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/i-hope-you-broke-your-29098020,"Patrice Evra has recalled the Manchester United dressing room’s furious reaction after Nani was stretchered off in a 3-1 defeat against Liverpool Patrice Evra has revealed the Manchester United dressing room’s furious reaction after Nani cried during a defeat to Liverpool in 2011. Dirk Kuyt scored a hat-trick at Anfield as the Reds ran out 3-1 winners, but the game is also still remembered for one horror tackle from Liverpool legend Jamie Carragher on Nani. The winger had already gifted the Reds their second goal of the afternoon, inexplicably heading Luis Suarez’s cross back into his own six-yard box for a grateful Kuyt to head home. But his game came to a premature end after he was stretchered off following Carragher’s challenge on the stroke of half-time.

More info The Liverpool defender surprisingly avoided a red card from referee Phil Dowd, with both sets of players angrily confronting each other in the aftermath of the incident. However, that came to an end after it was spotted that Nani was crying on the floor. And reflecting on the incident, Evra has admitted the United squad ""were ready to kill"" the Portuguese, revealing how he ended up being given a week off training following an angry confrontation with United manager Sir Alex Ferguson. “I remember when Nani had a crazy challenge against Jamie Carragher against Liverpool,” Evra recalled on BBC Radio 5 Live. “And we start coming and fighting with the player. “And I remember Paul Scholes saw Nani crying because you could see the bone. And when we saw that, we just said like, ‘come on guys!’ And we left. “I remember Ferguson at half-time when Nani was at the massage table and Ferguson came and he said, ‘I really hope you really broke your leg because crying at Anfield, this is impossible’. So this is to tell you the mentality. “We were waiting for Nani the next day and Ferguson had to give him one week off. He said, ‘I’ve given him one week off because mentally he is not ready to come back.’ But we were ready to kill him.”"

13, 2016 in Los Angeles, California. (Photo by Kevin Mazur/Getty Images) Can the new 'Inside the NBA' ever match the chemistry of Shaq, Barkley, and Reggie Miller? “I played 18 years professionally for the Pacers and right now this past year was my 18th year at Turner. So for 36 years, I’ve only known two things, yeah the Pacers and TNT and Turner.” NBA star turned-analyst Reggie Miller was very emotional last month about his future. The NBA was a step away from finalizing the new media rights set up of 11 years worth $76 billion with ESPN, Amazon, and NBC and Miller was sad about Inside the NBA not continuing further. But just when we thought TNT was out of the race, reports emerged this week that the network would use its matching rights to retain the NBA media rights. So, the Pacers legend was the happiest when he heard the news. On his Instagram, he wrote, “Well we have a pulse!! Now where it goes from here is above my pay grade, all I know is I’m excited to start my 20th season in the Fall with these dudes,” completing the statement with #LuckyAndBlessed. Miller uploaded a carousel of photos from the sets of Inside the NBA, featuring Charles Barkley, Shaquille O’Neal, Kenny Smith, and Ernie Johnson. He also shared BTS photos of his kids hanging around Barkley and Shaq. Wednesday was the deadline for TNT to submit the bid, and didn’t they leave it for the final day? ADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad As per reports, TNT Sports declared it will be matching one of its competitor’s deals to pay $1.8 to 2.2 billion annually to the league – a steep increase from the previous $1.2 billion. Although no name was mentioned, many reports have suggested TNT has matched tech giant Amazon’s C package. Poll 1 of 4  Do you think Reggie Miller's loyalty to Shaq and Barkley is justified?

At the time, he felt it was too quiet with no updates from their executives and hoped that the show continued. And he was not the only one who wanted the show to continue. Biggest names in entertainment and sports like Michael Ealy, Kenan Thompson, Quavo, Giannis Antetokounmpo, Mark Cuban, Steph Curry, and Magic Johnson joined the #KeepNBAonTNT campaign. The stars shared their stories on the docuseries about Inside the NBA. Although he was not a part of the docuseries, Miller also had a story to tell about his co-workers. ADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad Miller reckons what makes Inside the NBA a great show is the fact that it is unscripted, only Ernie Johnson has to lead the show in a direction. “But Shaq, Charles, Kenny what I mean he’s (Johnson) just throwing lobs and they’re finishing them.” Further, Reggie Miller said that the show provides honest feedback to the fans and players. That’s probably the reason for the high ratings of the show. During the NBA playoffs in May, TNT’s May 12 Game 4 coverage of the series drew 5.6 million viewers, whereas ESPN’s May 10 Game 3 coverage drew 5.2 million watchers, as per Nielsen. Meanwhile, none of the Inside the NBA guys have commented on the news of TNT using its matching rights. Maybe they are waiting for the final decision from the league. There have been reports that even if Warner Bros. Discovery intends to match the offer, there’s a chance Adam Silver, the commissioner of the NBA, might reject the offer. We will get a clearer picture in the upcoming weeks.

Chicago Bulls forward DeMar DeRozan, center, interrupts a postgame interview with guard Coby White on Feb. 6, 2024, at the United Center. (Vincent Alban/Chicago Tribune)When DeRozan arrived in Chicago three summers ago, I admittedly was not overwhelmed. He hadn’t made an All-Star team since 2017-18, and it seemed as though his best years were in the past. He basically disappeared in San Antonio following a stellar career in Toronto.But DeRozan soon proved he was far from finished, leading the Bulls to the top of the Eastern Conference at the outset of his first season. They had a 27-11 record and were atop the East on Jan. 11, 2022, and DeRozan had come up big so often that he earned his “King of the Fourth” moniker.But the Bulls’ season fell apart with the loss of Lonzo Ball two games later, and they never recovered. Karnišovas didn’t get DeRozan or LaVine any scoring help the next two offseasons, and both seasons resulted in losses in the play-in round.So the DeRozan era ended with a thud — only one playoff appearance, the 4-1 first-round loss to the Milwaukee Bucks in ’22.None of this was his fault, mind you. DeRozan continued to defy age and played almost every game in the era of load management, where veterans tend to sit out the second game of back-to-backs every opportunity they get.How many times does a 34-year-old lead the league in total minutes or minutes per game, as DeRozan did last year? I’ll hang up and listen for the answer.Love and losses: How DeMar DeRozan defined the Chicago Bulls during his 3-year tenureDeRozan said all along he loved Chicago and wanted to return, but assuredly he knew the Bulls weren’t interested, especially after the Caruso deal before the draft. DeRozan turns 35 next month, so perhaps it made perfect basketball sense for Karnišovas not to bring him back. The three-year, $74 million deal with the Kings carries some risks at his age.But DeRozan will now be a part of a new Big Three in Sacramento with De’Aaron Fox and Domantas Sabonis, and will have a better chance at finally winning a ring than he would’ve had in Chicago.Whether he can help make the Kings into a true contender in the West is debatable with the emergence of the young guns in Minnesota and Oklahoma City and a Denver team that now has something to prove after being knocked out of the playoffs by the Timberwolves in a Game 7 loss on their home court.Either way, Sacramento fans are already excited about the acquisition. DeRozan received a big ovation when he and Kings owner Vivek Ranadivé walked through the tunnel together at the Golden 1 Center on Saturday for the Kings’ California Summer League game. It was a king’s welcome if there ever was one.It was heartening to see, and a reminder of how much DeRozan was loved and respected in Chicago. He wasn’t just another basketball player for the Bulls, but the heartbeat of the franchise, one of the best teammates you could ask for and always available and accountable to the media no matter how tough a loss.Ayo Dosunmu, Coby White and Patrick Williams all owe him a debt of gratitude for teaching them how to be professionals. Hopefully, those lessons will endure.The Bulls might be able to replace his scoring, but it’s a stretch to believe they can replace DeRozan’s presence in the locker room. Maybe that doesn’t matter to Karnišovas if they keep getting younger and don’t intend on contending for a few years. But it should.Related Articles

			Trending:		 When DeMar DeRozan talked about the Chicago Bulls, he often talked about love.It wasn’t always outright. But beneath the jokes, the analysis and even the frustration, that affection was the most consistent undercurrent of DeRozan’s conversations. The trust he built with his teammates. The refusal to let a few hard weeks — or months, or years — shake his belief that he could make something happen here.Even as re-signing conversations stalled out in the final stretch of last season, DeRozan joked that negotiating with the team was like reasoning with a spouse after a fight: “What do we need to do to work on this, baby? Let’s figure this thing out. You want me. I want you.”The love never fully ran out. That was clear on the court, where DeRozan was always undeniably, recklessly invested. He played hurt. He played tired. Hell, he probably played too much. Last season, DeRozan led the NBA in playing time at the age of 34. In his three-year stint in Chicago, he played more than 90% of possible games.It wasn’t enough. Of course not. No amount of buzzer-beater heaves and 30-point games could outweigh the dysfunction and disrepair of the Bulls’ roster construction the past three years. But for three years, DeRozan lifted the Bulls to be more than they were meant to be.In Chicago, DeRozan got back to being himself.He had already rebuilt his game in San Antonio, but it took signing in Chicago to truly re-establish himself in the NBA. Over three seasons, DeRozan averaged 25.5 points while shooting 49.6% from the field. In the process, he earned back-to-back All-Star selections, notched 12 games with 40 or more points and cemented his moniker of “King in the Fourth” as a two-time Clutch Player of the Year runner-up.There was a moment when it seemed like all of this was going to work out here.

DeRozan’s first winter in Chicago was filled with hope. Despite all the offseason criticism, DeRozan was clicking alongside Zach LaVine, Lonzo Ball and Nikola Vučević. And there was nothing DeRozan loved more than proving doubters wrong.And then 2022 came. On Dec. 31, 2021, DeRozan launched off one leg as the clock ran down in Indianapolis, slinging a 3-pointer to close the year with a win over the Pacers. The next night, DeRozan repeated the feat, tossing in his signature pump fake before landing a dagger three from the corner in Washington D.C. to beat the Wizards.No player had ever made buzzer-beater game-winners from behind the arc on consecutive nights. It was another slice of history for DeRozan, another highlight that belied the weaknesses that would soon send the Bulls tumbling from their stature atop the Eastern Conference.The impossibility of that shot in Indiana — one leg up, the shot clock forgotten — captured everything that worked about DeRozan with the Bulls. But it’s the image that came after that that fully crystallized the hopefulness of the moment — DeRozan with his fists in the air, teammates hanging off his shoulders and dragging him to the ground, the clock run down to zero with the Bulls ahead by two.Darron Cummings/APBulls’ DeMar DeRozan celebrates with Coby White after DeRozan hit the game-winning shot against the Indiana Pacers, Dec. 31, 2021, in Indianapolis. (Darron Cummings/AP)After Coby White missed his own potential game-winning buzzer-beater in February, DeRozan didn’t hesitate to teach. He instructed a trainer to grab a laptop and pull up the film of the final play.

These are the traces that DeRozan will leave on this young roster. The confidence he imbued into White as a leader. The persistence he honed for rookies like Dalen Terry. On the court, DeRozan was best known for his deadly midrange jumpers and fourth-quarter heroism. But within the locker room, DeRozan made a name for himself with his Bulls teammates by just showing up.He drove hours to Champaign to see Ayo Dosunmu’s jersey retired by Illinois in the guard’s rookie year. He invited – or more accurately, compelled – every player under 23 to spend summers in Los Angeles training with him. When asked about those workouts the following preseason, DeRozan only grinned, relishing memories of putting the kids through hell.“The word ‘leadership’ is thrown around so much in the NBA,” Vučević told the Tribune after DeRozan’s All-Star selection in 2023. “It’s not something you can decide to be. You have to have it within yourself. DeMar has earned our respect — with the way he’s played, with his achievements, the way he comports himself on the court, off the court. He really took the time to make sure he knew everybody and established himself as somebody we could trust.”Three days into 2022, DeRozan couldn’t go home.It was an off night. The Bulls had beaten the Orlando Magic. DeRozan dropped 29 points, but he also went 7-for-13 from the free-throw line. Any hint of inaccuracy from the penalty stripe for DeRozan — a now-career 84.1% free throw shooter — was a sign of weakness he didn’t care to repeat.So he stayed. United Center workers began to strip the opposing stanchion, break down the sideline seating and peel up the court to reveal the ice concealed under the hardwood for an upcoming Blackhawks game. And DeRozan stayed until he made 250 shots from the stripe. Until he made things right.DeRozan never had the chance to make things right in Chicago. His departure to the Sacramento Kings reflected a harsher truth: there probably never was a chance. The Bulls were too broken, the roster too flawed. It was never going to work out.But the love was there. That was never in doubt. And as the Bulls take their next steps, the impact of DeRozan’s devotion to his team will remain — on the court and in the locker room, and within this young generation he shaped. It wasn’t always outright. But beneath the jokes, the analysis and even the frustration, that affection was the most consistent undercurrent of DeRozan’s conversations. The trust he built with his teammates. The refusal to let a few hard weeks — or months, or years — shake his belief that he could make something happen here. Even as re-signing conversations stalled out in the final stretch of last season, DeRozan joked that negotiating with the team was like reasoning with a spouse after a fight: “What do we need to do to work on this, baby? Let’s figure this thing out. You want me. I want you.” The love never fully ran out. That was clear on the court, where DeRozan was always undeniably, recklessly invested. He played hurt. He played tired. Hell, he probably played too much. Last season, DeRozan led the NBA in playing time at the age of 34. In his three-year stint in Chicago, he played more than 90% of possible games.

Credit: Kyle Terada-USA TODAY Sports Is Jaylen Brown's controversy a sign of deeper issues within the team? USA basketball’s managing director, Grant Hill, has been caught in a wave of controversies since the Olympics began. It started with Jaylen Brown‘s exclusion from the squad, and then Jayson Tatum not receiving enough playing time during the Olympic games. Even though Hill said that he would consider Brown in the 2028 Olympic squad, things have not cooled down yet. Team USA went to the Olympics with a star-studded lineup, which comprised 12 players top-tier NBA players. Yes, they won the gold, but it was not all sunshine and rainbows behind the scenes. With that much talent, not everyone got the minutes they wanted – even the big names from the NBA squads. Just look at Jayson Tatum-he ended up with multiple DNPs, as he sat out two whole games with no playing time and not everyone was happy with it. In light of that, veteran NBA analyst Brian Windhorst advised Grant Hill to pick the young players going ahead, to avoid all the drama. The idea is to start developing the young players specifically for FIBA competitions and to build a squad that is down to stick together through a few summers, leading up to big events like the 2028 Olympics. “I don’t necessarily think it’s the worst idea in the world to take all young guys to the World Cup. Like, do what they do in soccer of the Olympics and say, we are gonna take all 23 and under,” Windhorst mentioned on the ESPN podcast. ADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad “Because we[Team USA] are gonna start developing FIBA players. We are gonna say, ‘hey, commit to playing in the summer in 2026, commit to playing the summer in 27′ and you are not promised for 28’ but let’s see where it leads. Maybe there shouldn’t be, in spots 11 and 12, maybe there shouldn’t be star players there. Maybe there should be FIBA players, NBA players, don’t get me wrong, but FIBA players who have played for multiple summers in a row,” the media vet further added. Is Jaylen Brown's controversy a ticking time bomb for Team USA? React! Reactions Windhorst wants Team USA to create a crew that’s more in sync with international play. After all, it’s all about long-term growth and commitment, not just banking on NBA stars. Talking about NBA stars though, what’s been brewing between Grant Hill and Jaylen Brown? Let’s dive deep. It was not that long ago that Jaylen Brown took a shot at Team USA and Nike, letting everyone know he was not cool with Team USA picking his Celtics teammate, Derrick White, as Kawhi Leonard‘s replacement instead of him. The current finals MVP tweeted, “@nike this what we doing.” Brown was probably implying it was Nike that kept him off the Team USA roster. ADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad In response, Hill said, “And, so, whatever theories that might be out there, they’re just that. But that’s my responsibility. And it’s tough. It’s tough to have conversations, tell people that they’re not on the team.” Jaylen Brown did not take too kindly to being called a conspiracy theorist by the USAB managing director, as he shot back, stating, “Grant Hill calling me a conspiracy theorist is disappointing. I’ve been a VP [of the NBPA] since I was 21 years old, I have a great understanding.” However, Grant Hill now wants to squash the beef. He is even open to having Brown on the Team USA squad in the 2028 Olympics. “It’s a lot of noise. I’m confident he and I will sit down at some point and talk about it and get to some level of understanding. He’ll be a candidate, if he wants, in 2028. One thing I’ve learned, you can’t take anything personally in this role. I haven’t personalized anything. My objective, my goal, is to win. And as soon as, hopefully, that happens, we pivot and start looking ahead to the future,” Hill said. As this might have been the last season for many of the veteran players in the Olympics, there will probably be space for Jaylen Brown on the Team USA roster for the 2028 Olympics. But the question is, after all that has happened, will Brown accept the offer to be a part of Team USA? What are your thoughts?

Sports After signing a historic $304 million extension, Jaylen Brown set out on a valiant goal. He wanted to bring back ‘Black Wall Street’ in Boston. Living up to his vows, Brown launched Boston XChange, an initiative to help empower underserved communities and bridge the vast wealth gaps in the city. But why stop at Boston? Only days after the Boston initiative, Brown, in collaboration with Dallas Maverick’s head coach Jason Kidd has launched the Oakland XChange. The aim remains the same, to improve the community and help upscale underrepresented businesses. To do so, the reigning Finals rivals let their common love for Oakland make possible the launch of the empowerment initiative. Through the Oakland XChange, Jaylen Brown and Kidd hope to raise $5 billion to assist the community and its businesses by providing the resources and knowledge necessary to grow their projects. Additionally, they are also partnering with Oakstop, an organization that has worked to develop the Oakland community over the past 10 years. ADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad     A post shared by NBPA (@thenbpa)  Their primary motive is to raise sufficient funds to buy real estate assets that will be dedicated as space for creator businesses. “Giving resources back to our community and allowing them to have opportunities, I think, is key. The wealth gap is widening in other places of the US, not just Boston, so to be able to invest in our community is important,” said Jaylen Brown, an alumnus of the University of California. Jason Kidd also celebrated the initiative as an ‘off-court championship’ in partnership with Brown. The Hall of Fame point guard is a native of Oakland and has invested heavily in the community. ADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad While it’s been a busy week for Jaylen Brown, it has been a memorable one for Team USA. Both the men’s and women’s basketball teams that traveled to Paris achieved the expected gold medals. Likewise, the NBA community was bursting with pride. Brown’s teammates, Jayson Tatum, Derrick White, and Jrue Holiday all were a part of the gold medal roster. But even then, probably alluding to his ongoing rift with USAB, Jaylen Brown didn’t release any statement over the team’s Paris success. In the past, the Celtics Finals MVP has criticized the board for excluding him from the squad. Furthermore, he went as far as igniting a war with Nike, pinning them for his snub. ADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad However, despite getting off on the wrong foot, team director Grant Hill has left the door open for Jaylen Brown to join the 2028 Olympic team when the competition will be held in Los Angeles. The 27-year-old community leader is yet to have made his allegiance clear. But after Tatum’s lackluster Paris experience, there is a chance the Boston pair decide against participating in 2028.

Kevin Jairaj-USA TODAY Sports Jaylen Brown vs. Nike—Who's in the wrong here? Share your thoughts! From appearance alone, there are no reservations when looking at the adorned Team USA Olympic team. Packed with the best of the league, youngsters, and veterans, there is no weakness. However, a major point of discussion was the exclusion of Jaylen Brown. As the reigning Finals MVP, Brown felt sour about being excluded, even blaming Nike. But with three other Celtics teammates on the roster, did the organization make an effort to push his case? Recently, Celtics president Brad Stevens spoke to the Boston Globe about the entire situation. Having seen Brown’s dexterity for years, Stevens had no doubt over his capabilities. But at the same time, the former head coach of the Celtics isn’t one to meddle in the process. Although he did put in a good word. “I just tell everybody how great our guys are, and then I stay out of it. I think that’s my role. I think Jaylen could be on any Olympic team any given year. He could be a featured part of those teams. I saw [USA Basketball director Grant Hill] said he’d love to sit down and talk to him about being part of that pool in ‘28, whatever that may be,” Stevens told the Boston Globe.

Additionally, Grant also previously revealed his having a conversation with Brown’s agent and explaining “it was really truly a basketball decision”. Jaylen Brown though seems unconvinced and has proclaimed to speak more in-depth about his exclusion at a later time. While it isn’t a pleasant situation, Stevens feels the 27-year-old will return with a vengeance. Even before the Paris Olympics saga, Jaylen Brown was among the best combo guards in the entire league. His fervor during the postseason showed flashes of his true potential as he improved as a defender and became the focal attack point. His diligent efforts were rewarded with MVPs in both the ECF and the NBA Finals. ADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad But is there another level to his basketball gifts? Stevens feels the Olympics snub will motivate Jaylen Brown to evolve his game a step further. “But I think Jaylen is one of the best players in the world. And one of the best things about Jaylen is whether he gets the call and makes the team or doesn’t get the call, he’s going to use it as motivation to get better. So I know he’s working and he’s excited about improving. I think he’ll truly embrace the challenges that come with winning last year. That’s who he’s always been. And this will probably add more fuel to his fire. But he doesn’t need much fuel added. He finds it,” Stevens said. The NBA landscape has changed drastically in the months since the Celtics claimed their 18th title. Teams such as the New York Knicks and Philadelphia 76ers have made major trades in the offseason. Similar to the West, the East is no longer a one-sided conference. The Celtics will face much severe competition, not only due to the improved teams but also their status as the current champions. ADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad And it’s never easy to repeat. At the same time, the Celtics are looking to begin a dynasty spearheaded by Jaylen Brown and Jayson Tatum. With the sweet taste of victory, the prolific duo is not one to let the competition steal what’s theirs. Nor are the Celtics a team that likes to lose.

Jaylen Brown,USA Basketball: Grant Hill says Jaylen Brown will be considered for 2028 Olympics after omission in Paris,https://www.cbssports.com/olympics/news/usa-basketball-grant-hill-says-jaylen-brown-will-be-considered-for-2028-olympics-after-omission-in-paris/,"If not listed, please contact your TV provider. USA Basketball director Grant Hill hopes to clear the air with Boston Celtics forward Jaylen Brown. Brown took issue with not being selected as a replacement on the 2024 Paris Olympics roster after Kawhi Leonard withdrew from the team. Team USA elected to choose Brown's Celtics teammate Derrick White for the open roster spot, leading to Brown calling out USA Basketball and Nike, the official apparel brand for Team USA.  Brown implied on social media that Nike was the reason he was kept off the team, to which Hill responded at the time, saying in part, ""Whatever theories that might be out there, they're just that. But that's my responsibility. And it's tough. It's tough to have conversations, tell people that they're not on the team.""  Brown then shot back on social media, calling out Hill, saying, ""Grant Hill calling me a conspiracy theorist is disappointing. I've been a VP [of the NBPA] since I was 21 years old I have a great understanding.""  While the dust had settled on the situation since the Olympics started, Hill said on the Open Run podcast with Rachel Nichols that he hopes to talk with Brown and that he will be considered for the 2028 Los Angeles Olympics.  ""When you have a team with the profile of players on this team, you know there's going to be controversy. You know that coming in, I knew that. I think what people fail to realize is I'm a fan of basketball, and I'm a fan of these guys that are playing in the current era...My whole approach is to celebrate the greatness of today's players. So yeah it was disappointing. You gotta do your job, I've tried to do this the right way. When we first put out the roster back in April, before it was announced, I called certain guys. I called Paul George, Damian Lillard, Jaylen Brown, I felt like they were of a certain stature where they deserved to hear it before it was made public. And I appreciated their willingness to want to be a part of this, but also wanted them to appreciate just how difficult this was. To me that was leading with integrity, doing the right thing, recognizing who they are, what they've meant to USA basketball in years past."" 	 ... 	 ""It's a lot of noise, I'm confident he and I will sit down at some point and talk about it and get to some level of understanding. He'll be a candidate, if he wants, in 2028. One thing I've learned, you can't take anything personal in this role. I haven't personalized anything, my objective, my goal is to win. And as soon as, hopefully, that happen, we pivot and start looking ahead to the future.""  Brown certainly has the resume to make the USA Basketball roster, especially after this season, during which he finished as an NBA champion and Finals MVP while leading the Celtics throughout the postseason to their first title since 2008. But making the roster for USA Basketball is the most difficult team to make, given all the talent. You could argue that he should've been named the replacement over White, but there were very good reasons to have White on the roster over Brown, too. While Team USA looks on pace to earn its fifth straight gold medal, the 2028 Olympics will be a total change of guard for the men's basketball team. LeBron James could be retired, and Kevin Durant and Stephen Curry will be 39 and 40 years old, respectively, so naturally, there will be more room for Brown to be on the roster. Hill sounds more than ready to bury the hatchet; we'll just have to see if Brown is willing to do the same. © 2004-2024 CBS Interactive. All Rights Reserved.

Tyson Chandler,"Conor McGregor's next fight will be against Michael Chandler, whose nickname is a homage to Mike Tyson",https://talksport.com/sport/mma/1325717/conor-mcgregor-michael-chandler-fight-nickname-mike-tyson/,"Conor McGregor is fighting a man inspired by the great Mike Tyson when he returns to the octagon this year. The Irishman has been out of action since fracturing his tibia and fibula in his trilogy fight defeat to Dustin Poirier at UFC 264 in July 2021, but now has a confirmed plan for his comeback, which will see him face Michael Chandler. UFC president Dana White announced on Saturday that McGregor and Chandler will work as coaches on the company's reality series, The Ultimate Fighter, before fighting at the end of the season. As yet, the date has not been set. Chandler's nickname, 'Iron', is inspired by boxing's heavyweight legend 'Iron' Mike Tyson. He did not begin his career with the moniker, though, and only adopted it after meeting Tyson in person. Following his win over Eddie Alvarez - whom McGregor later beat - for the Bellator lightweight title in 2011, Chandler spotted a long queue of people while walking with a friend through a mall in Las Vegas. It turned out that the line led to a Tyson autograph signing. “Tyson gave me some advice,” Chandler revealed. “He just said, ‘Champ, it’s easy coming up. Then as soon as you get the belt and everyone’s gunning for you. Every single person’s looking at you, they’re waking up, thinking about fighting you, they’re going to bed, thinking about fighting you.' ""He said, 'You’ve got this big target on your back. That should motivate you. You’ve got to do things right. You’ve got to work hard."" Tyson earned the nickname 'Iron Mike' in his heyday as boxing's heavyweight king, tearing through the division and becoming the youngest champion in heavyweight history in 1986. Now, Chandler is once again the hunter, rather than the hunted, as he will be looking to take McGregor's scalp later this year. Get up to £40 in free bets* - CLAIM HERE 18+ New customers only.

LaMarcus Aldridge,LaMarcus Aldridge retires as one of his generation's unluckiest and most underappreciated NBA superstars,https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/lamarcus-aldridge-retires-as-one-of-his-generations-unluckiest-and-most-underappreciated-nba-superstars/,"If not listed, please contact your TV provider. An undercurrent of disrespect permeated LaMarcus Aldridge's 2015 free agency. For a week that July, he was the center of the NBA universe, the lone championship-altering force on a market accustomed to players just a hair greater. Aldridge was never LeBron James or Kevin Durant, but for that one week, he was treated like it, and it was a feeling he seemingly wanted to replicate in perpetuity. Despite winning 105 games in his last two seasons in Portland, reports indicated that his desire to compete for championships was matched or perhaps exceeded by his longing for validation. Adrian Wojnarowski even reported at the time that Aldridge ""loathed"" driving around Portland and seeing the many billboards Adidas had posted featuring teammate Damian Lillard. Free agency was an opportunity to win, but more importantly, it was an opportunity to do so on his own terms.  It's something Aldridge -- who announced his retirement for the second time on Friday -- never really got to do in 16 NBA seasons. He started his career as the third wheel to a preordained Brandon Roy-Greg Oden dynasty, and by the time injuries ruined it, Lillard's ascent rendered him a sidekick on the only team he'd ever known. The egalitarian theory of the Spurs offered an alternative that Kawhi Leonard's brilliance swallowed in practice. Aldridge asked for a trade after his second season in San Antonio and rescinded it only after Leonard's injury granted him the spotlight he so craved but never quite deserved. The Aldridge-led Spurs were good. They made the playoffs. But without a Leonard-caliber leading man, Aldridge was never going to win a championship.  It makes his career an interesting case study in compromise. Sidekicking is notoriously tedious. Stars routinely grumble about the sacrifices it takes to win alongside superior teammates, but Aldridge never got the chance. He reached the conference finals only once, and by the time he was willing to sacrifice enough of the trappings of stardom to reach the absolute highest levels of winning, it was too late. Aldridge played only five games on the contending 2020-21 Nets before a heart condition ended his season. He played 47 more games for the Nets in 2021-22, but the team fell way short of expectations. It was the least satisfying possible outcome for Aldridge's career: he never held the keys to a franchise as Lillard does now, nor did he have the chance to ride shotgun on the way to someone else's championship.  It was ultimately a case of poor luck on both fronts, and it dates back to the very beginning of his career. The Toronto Raptors held the No. 1 overall pick in the 2006 NBA Draft, and despite the pleas of fellow Texan Chris Bosh, opted for Andrea Bargnani as their top choice. That robbed Aldridge of an ideal long-term frontcourt partner, a modern mismatch machine of a duo that would have drawn opposing bigs out of the paint a full decade before they were ready to. One pick later, the Chicago Bulls drafted him at No. 2, and for a moment, the chance to serve as Michael Jordan's long-awaited successor could have made Aldridge one of the league's brightest young stars. That pick's original owner offered similar marketability. Had they not traded for Eddy Curry, Aldridge may well have begun his career as the face of the New York Knicks.  But big market fame eluded him after a trade to Portland that should have earned him some jewelry. Injuries to Oden and Roy and then Leonard in San Antonio only scratch the surface of why it didn't. The 2013-14 Blazers started the season 31-9 before injuries to Aldridge cost them a possible 60-win season. A year later, Portland trailed only the nascent Warriors in the Western Conference standings when Wes Matthews tore his Achilles and knocked the Blazers out of championship contention. Neither was Aldridge's best team, though. That honor belongs to the historically overlooked 2016 Spurs.  Fun fact: the 73-win Warriors of 2016 didn't have the NBA's best point differential. San Antonio's plus-11.1 net rating outpaced Golden State's plus-10.6. The Spurs had the NBA's No. 4-ranked offense and best overall defense, but ran into a Durant-shaped buzzsaw in the second round of the postseason. Durant's Warriors knocked Aldridge and the Spurs out of the postseason again a year later when Leonard landed on Zaza Pachulia's foot in what would have been a Game 1 rout. Just like that, Aldridge's title hopes were dashed. His loss, ironically, was the gain of one of his draftmates. Kyle Lowry also had a brief window to contend with Leonard, but when that very Raptors team that didn't draft Aldridge ran into Durant in 2019, the player that deprived Aldridge of his title was injured.  Lowry will forever be remembered as a champion based on that run, and justifiably so, but he benefited from circumstances that deprived Aldridge of the same privilege. By most traditional measures of individual success—points, All-Star appearances, All-NBA nods, career earnings—his career was superior. It won't be remembered quite as fondly without that feather in his cap. It's no wonder Aldridge was so image-conscious in 2015. Portland couldn't give him a championship, but it couldn't give him what it gave Lillard, either.  It makes legislating his legacy a somewhat complicated affair. Aldridge fits in no defined box and his career has no identifiable arc. He was a constant, never changing a mid-range shooting style that carried him from evolutionary to anachronism across a changing league. For over a decade, he flirted with the traditional benchmark of big man stardom—the coveted ""20 and 10"" status symbol that has long since gone out of fashion—yet between 2008 and 2018, his scoring never deviated by more than six points per game. He just kept chugging along, putting up All-Star caliber numbers on teams only locals and league pass junkies ever watched. It irked Aldridge enough to take matters into his own hands. He asked for trades in 2013 and 2017 and used free agency to change teams in 2015, always looking for something slightly different. Perhaps sensing the end was near, he used a recent buyout to take one last swing at the championship that eluded him. But in the grand scheme of his career, it seems appropriate that he won't end up winning one. Not because he isn't deserving, but because without one, the discourse will have to meet him on his terms. Remembering LaMarcus Aldridge means reckoning with an often unsatisfying career, but an enormously successful one regardless.  Those unkind circumstances can enforce a somewhat more honest conversation about who Aldridge was as a player. There is no easy narrative, no legendary team, or mind-boggling statistic to condense his contributions into. He won't be on billboards now that his career is over. He was just a great player whose talent was narrowly beaten out by his poor luck. That luck robbed him of the attention his talent warranted during his career. With some distance, it's praise he more than deserves in retirement.  © 2004-2024 CBS Interactive. All Rights Reserved. CBS Sports is a registered trademark of CBS Broadcasting Inc.

Aaron Davidson/Getty Images) Scottie Pippen's kids are thriving—do you think they’ll follow in his legendary footsteps? Scotty Pippen Jr. often makes it to the headlines, but the other kids of the ex-Bulls Star? Not so much. Many basketball enthusiasts would still know of Pip’s 4 children with Larsa. However, not much is reported about the other three children that the 6x NBA champ had before them. Notably, these three children come from three different exes of Scottie Pippen — Karen McCollum, Sonya Roby, and Yvette Deleone. Let’s have a closer look at not just Pip’s 7 children, but also at what they have been up to. And what kind of bond do they share with their father? ADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad The fans of the 7x All-Star would know that long before Larsa, Pippen was married to Karen McCollum. And it was with his first wife that he welcomed his firstborn — Antron — into this world in December 1987. Growing up in Lawrenceville, he played basketball for South Georgia Technical College and later for the World Basketball Association in 2013. If one is to believe Scottie, his son was a late bloomer, but still better than him in high school. Poll 1 of 4  Which of Scottie Pippen's seven kids do you think will make the biggest impact in sports? Antron Pippen Scotty Pippen Jr. Preston Pippen Sierra Pippen Justin Pippen Sophia Pippen Taylor Pippen Have an interesting take?  Join Debate Who do you think handled the Anthony Edwards and Adidas controversy better? Anthony Edwards Adidas Noah Lyles Usain Bolt Have an interesting take?  Join Debate Do you think Dennis Rodman was a good father to Alexis? Yes No It's complicated Not sure Have an interesting take?  Join Debate Which of Devin Booker's rumored relationships surprised you the most? Kendall Jenner Jordyn Woods Christina Nadin Hannah Harrison Have an interesting take?  Join Debate But before we could see more of Antron’s basketball talents on the big stage, he passed away at 33. Although Pip never revealed the exact cause of death, he shared in an IG post that his son suffered from chronic asthma. “He never let that get him down, though — Antron stayed positive and worked hard, and I am so proud of the man that he became,” read the post. This was the 6x NBA champ’s only child with his first wife.       A post shared by Scottie Pippen (@scottiepippen)  His second child came into this world in July 1994 with his ex-girlfriend, Sonya Roby. The fact he did not want to accept the parental responsibility of his first daughter may surprise some fans. As per the information by the Associated Press, he accepted Taylor Pippen as his daughter only after a DNA test disapproved of his denial. Following this, Scottie Pippen agreed to provide financial support, while Roby retained the full custody of her daughter. But it turns out his relationship with his eldest daughter remained limited to this arrangement itself. “I know that people expect a lot from me, but, after all these years, I have learned that Pippen is just that, a last name,” Taylor said in an interview. But her development into an accomplished athlete proves that the apple doesn’t fall from the tree, no matter what. Not only did Taylor play volleyball for Southern Illinois University, but went pro in Spain for one season in 2016.  By 2024, she became the Vice President of Commercial Banking at JP Morgan Chase & Co. Notably, Taylor also had a twin sister named Tyler, but she died soon after her birth at the hospital itself. As for Pip’s last child before marrying Larsa, he had yet again denied being the father. After a paternity suit by his ex-girlfriend, Yvette Deleone, the court revealed Scottie to be the father of Sierra Pippen. The ex-Bulls star eventually reached a settlement, where he agreed to cover all the educational and other expenses of his daughter born in February 1995. Having attended the University of Iowa, Sierra believes in keeping the rest of her personal life mostly to herself. Most hardcore fans of the 7x All-Star would remember Pip marrying Larsa in July 1997, and welcoming his first son with her — Scotty Pippen Jr. — in November 2000. Pippen Jr. has reached the highest level of basketball among any of his children. However, it’s not as if the journey was easy for him just because he carried a certain surname. In fact, despite averaging impressive numbers in his college days for Vanderbilt Commodores, Pippen Jr. went undrafted in 2022. But he later made his way to the Los Angeles Lakers through a two-way deal under which he played for the franchise’s G-League team as well. But he did not get much of a chance at the big league until he moved to the Memphis Grizzlies.        A post shared by NBA G League (@nbagleague)  ADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad Meanwhile, Pip’s second child with Larsa is the complete opposite of his elder brother. As per an article by PEOPLE, Scottie Pippen’s second son with the RHOM star, Preston Pippen, likes to stay away from the spotlight. And this is the reason we don’t have many updates on him following his high school basketball life. While Preston likes to stay away from the spotlight, his younger brother Justin seems to have thrived under it. Notably, apart from trying his hands at basketball, Pip’s youngest son also gave modeling a try. Additionally, Justin appeared in True Faces of the World campaign in 2016 with his sister Sophia. The campaign reportedly featured kids with different backgrounds and cultures. Now, Scottie Pippen’s youngest, and last child with Larsa, is his daughter Sophia. And she has the luxury of making the surprising claim that her godmother is Kim Kardashian. Larsa’s friendship with Kim may have reportedly suffered a blow after her split with Kanye West. But it seems that the goddaughter-godmother connection still remains. Now, it’s important to highlight that though Pip’s relationship with his other children is not so sorted, he shares a great bond with all his children with Larsa.  ADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad Stay tuned for more such updates.

Ndamukong Suh,"I played with Tom Brady, beat Patrick Mahomes to Super Bowl and learned to embrace 'hated' tag from Nike billionaire",https://talksport.com/sport/1607565/ndamukong-suh-tom-brady-super-bowl-mahomes-phil-knight/,"Ndamukong Suh was Tom Brady's Super Bowl-winning teammate, received critical life advice from Nike co-founder Phil Knight, and was once best known as the most hated player in the NFL.  Now that Suh is entering the media world while still searching for an ideal playing situation - like he found last season with the Philadelphia Eagles - one of the best defenders during the last two decades is opening up and revealing the real man behind the facemask.  ""I did everything that it took and played right to the edge,"" Suh exclusively told talkSPORT. ""For me, you're not supposed to like me. And I'm not doing my job if you do like me."" Suh -- who was again linked with the Miami Dolphins after Bradley Chubb's injury -- was open, honest and at ease during the interview in London, where he's been living for the last month while working as an NFL analyst for Sky Sports. The five-time Pro Bowler with 600 career tackles, 71.5 sacks and three Super Bowl appearances also wasn't afraid to say what he really thinks, which wasn't the case during his early playing days when he realized he'd been painted as a classic NFL bad guy. ""I started to learn, man, (the media) need to have hot stories and they need to have people to talk about,"" he said. ""They also need to have the pretty boy in Tom Brady, the All Star in Peyton Manning and you've got to have the villain.  ""I was one of those villains that fit in perfectly. Just from that standpoint, I started to embrace those things and I really learned that from Phil Knight."" Mentioning Brady soon had Suh reflecting on Tampa Bay's 2020 season, which initially was filled with drama and question marks but ended with a dominant 31-9 victory over Patrick Mahomes and the Kansas City Chiefs in Super Bowl LV. Brady was a ""great teammate,"" Suh said. The greatest quarterback of all time also put in the necessary work and knew how to get the best out of his teammates.  ""I see why he's so good, just because of his work ethic and the things that he builds himself off, and that mindset and focus,"" Suh said.  ""But as a true champion - and this is what I learned earlier on in my career, in probably my second and third year - you're only as good as the people around you. If they're not bought into how you work and you can't make them better, you will not move far."" The 13-year veteran remembers a challenging mid-season conversation within the Buccaneers in 2020 that changed Tampa Bay's year and pointed Bruce Arians' team toward the top of the world. ""Guys look how talented we are and we're playing at such an average level,"" Suh recalled. ""It's not because of our talent. It's because we haven't come together as a unit and stopped being selfish."" Arians was the perfect sideline leader for those Bucs and rivals Jim Caldwell as the best coach that Suh has played for.  ""Bruce is like, 'You guys want to win? It's on you.' Like, I'm going to give you everything,"" Suh said. ""I'm going to listen to you. You guys want to change things, you want to run practice differently, you want to do it this way, do it that way, we'll do it. But at the end of the day, you have ownership in this."" The 2010 Defensive Rookie of the Year took Arians' advice to heart when Tampa Bay had two weeks to prepare for the big game against Mahomes and the Chiefs. Suh said that he told then-defensive coordinator Todd Bowles that a normal blitz-heavy scheme needed to be tweaked to take down a Kansas City offense that would attack the Bucs' secondary.  ""We'll attack with this front seven and, trust me, we will get there,"" Suh said. ""We just ate that offensive line and their offense alive, because we had that confidence and we knew what we were going to do and we were all on the same page and we believed."" Last year, Suh believed that he had his second world championship wrapped up.  Philadelphia led Mahomes' team 24-14 at halftime, with Jalen Hurts outplaying the biggest Chief and the Eagles just 30 minutes away from a shining trophy. ""All we needed to do was on the defensive side of the ball -- because offense was lights out the entire time -- just take care of our responsibility,"" Suh said. ""And I feel in some cases we got outcoached and outplayed in the second half of that game, and obviously that led to us losing the match. ""Those emotions going through that, having lost my first Super Bowl and then winning my second Super Bowl, to be able to have an opportunity and be in that position to where you're like 30 minutes away from being a Super Bowl champion for the second time, that really stung."" Suh would have retired after the 2022 season if the Eagles had won it all.  Instead, one of the game's fiercest defenders relied on his young children to help him get through the pain of losing another game on the NFL's biggest stage. ""If we had won, I would have probably been done,"" Suh said. ""Walk away being a champion and then ride off into the sunset and see what the media world had for me."" He added: ""The only thing that really probably got me through that was knowing I'm coming home to my kids. They don't know a difference. They're barely 2. They're just excited."" A two-game suspension in 2011 for stomping on a Green Bay Packers player ended up being a life changer for Suh, thanks to a private conversation with Knight. ""I went home (to Oregon) and Phil Knight asked me to come meet him in his office at Nike where I trained every offseason, even to this day,"" Suh said. ""And we just had an amazing hour, hour and a half conversation, and he just laid it out to me."" Suh became more in control of his playing style, career focus and overall image. Twelve years later, he's waiting on one more NFL call while exploring the media world. After winning a Super Bowl with Brady and spending more than a decade as one of the league's biggest villains, Suh believes that his powerful career should end up in Canton, Ohio.  ""I don't regret anything,"" Suh said. ""I love every moment of my career and hopefully that will surmount to me being a Hall of Fame player once I do decide to retire.""

Steve Kerr Decision Could Make Team USA a Boston Celtics Powerhouse, Here's How",https://www.essentiallysports.com/nba-active-basketball-news-will-jayson-tatum-lead-the-charge-in-two-thousand-twenty-eight-olympics-steve-kerr-decision-could-make-team-usa-a-boston-celtics-powerhouse-here-s-how/,"More Sports ES Fancast Aug 11, 2024 | 7:57 PM EDT Can Jayson Tatum turn Team USA into a Celtics-dominated powerhouse in the 2028 Olympics? The announcement of the 2024 Olympics roster drew criticism from many. With the kind of talent available in the NBA and the no. of players willing to play, disagreements were more than bound to happen. But soon, another controversy pretty much rocked the Olympic boat. Steve Kerr, deciding not to play Jayson Tatum in the tournament opener, really ruffled serious feathers. But then again, taking a look at the whole Team USA campaign, Kerr has been at the receiving end of the short stick for his player combinations. Come 2028, when the next round of the Olympics rolls up, it seems like the USA Basketball board could very well turn into a Celtics powerhouse. For one, choosing Derrick White, over 2024 Finals MVP Jaylen Brown, after Kawhi Leonard withdrew his candidature, had put Managing Director Grant Hill in the spotlight—and not the good kind. At the time, Hill calmed the crowd with a promise. If Brown was willing, he’d have a place in the 2028 Olympic roster. And for all the Tatum fans, this new Evan Sidery update on X would also prove to be quite a relief. “Steve Kerr is likely to retire as Team USA head coach, which means a new lead voice for 2028 in Los Angeles. Erik Spoelstra is viewed as the strong internal favorite to become Team USA’s next in line following Gregg Popovich and Kerr.” ADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad Along with Kerr, LeBron James, Kevin Durant, and Stephen Curry – the three-headed hydra of Team USA- are also likely to be retiring. While it’s true that it’s a tough position to fill, it’s still vacant. And by 2028, there’s no doubt that JT, JB, and White would very well adorn the veteran badge. And if the 30-year-old is still a Celtic, Team USA would, in effect, be a ‘Celtics powerhouse’. Poll 1 of 4  Do you think Jayson Tatum can lead Team USA to Olympic gold in 2028?

And they went public with their criticism. The head coach, however, has played it diplomatic across the board and he delivered on the promise of bringing the Gold medal back home. Even though the critics couldn’t say much after that, as even Jayson was seen sharing a broad smile with his teammates, let’s dive deeper and see what his mother and franchise owner had to say earlier. It was only a matter of time before Brandy Cole would be forced to put her foot down. Her son just led his team to an NBA title in the wake of the best record in the league. He earned a spot on the All-NBA first team for 3 years straight and received All-Star recognition for 5 years! So yes, Mama Tatum was indignant. And she made sure to let Kerr know of it when she replied to a tweet from ESPN’s Dick Vitale. “Someone pls let me know is @jaytatum0 injured as he hasn’t received the PT ( playing time ) u would expect an All NBA player to get,” Vitale posted from his X account. Cole immediately took the chance to re-tweet with a dig of her own. “No he not. But if you find out what’s going on please let me know – unacceptable and makes NO SENSE.” If Kerr thought JT’s mom was the only one who had some words for him, think again. ADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad Kerr’s actions also stupefied Boston’s majority owner, Grousbeck. Appearing on the Greg Hill Show, recently, he said, “I mean, I wouldn’t play Steve Kerr. Let me put it that way… It’s a complete mystery. I think Jayson doesn’t deserve anything but praise, kudos and playing time. I think he and Jaylen [Brown] led us to this unbelievable championship and they’re not apparently helping the Olympic team. It’s mystifying.” Clearly, there are a lot of people who are unhappy with Steve Kerr. But even amid such disappointing circumstances, Jayson Tatum has his fill of happiness. The NBA championship, obviously. But the Tatum family welcomed another member. After the Team USA win, the 2x Olympian and his family posed for family portraits, and who else to join them, but Grammy winning-singer and Tatum’s baby mama, Ella Mai? Anyway, the 2028 Team USA roster is going to be very interesting. If not for anything else, to see if Grant Hill makes good on his word. What do you think?

Enes Freedom,Enes Kanter Freedom slams LeBron James over China after scoring record,https://nypost.com/2023/02/08/enes-kanter-freedom-slams-lebron-james-over-china-after-scoring-record/,"Enes Kanter Freedom took a jab at LeBron James after the Lakers star surpassed Kareem Abdul-Jabbar to become the NBA’s all-time leading scorer on Tuesday.  The free-agent big man — who was waived by the Rockets in February 2022, a few days after the Celtics traded him to Houston — sent a sarcastic message to James on Twitter after the historic moment.  “38,388 Points, 0 Morals, 0 Values, 0 Principles, 0 Empathy, 1 bow down to China” Freedom wrote on Twitter. “Congratulations to @KingJames.”  James has yet to publicly address Freedom’s tweet. The criticism, though, was not surprising as Freedom is a longtime critic of James.  The 11-year NBA veteran has disapproved of both the NBA’s and of James’ silence on human rights atrocities in China, and has spoken out against authoritarian regimes.  38,388 Points 0 Morals0 Values0 Principles0 Empathy1 Bow Down to #ChinaCongratulations to @KingJames Advertisement In November 2021, the Swiss-born, Turkish-raised center became an American citizen and legally changed his last name to “Freedom” amid his human rights activism.  That same month, Freedom wore sneakers on the court trolling James with an illustration that depicted him bowing to China’s president, Xi Jinping, as he put a crown on James’ head.  Freedom condemned James’ business with Nike and accused the brand of telling a “total lie” about China’s alleged use of slave labor to produce its products. Nike has denied using slave labor. “Money over Morals for the ‘King,’” Freedom tweeted in November 2021. “Sad & disgusting how these athletes pretend they care about social justice.” Freedom was also critical of James’ comments in 2019, when James criticized Daryl Morey’s support for Hong Kong. At the time, James said Morey, who at the time was the Rockets’ GM and is now the 76ers’ president of basketball operations, was “misinformed” and “not educated” as Hong Kong citizens were protesting incursions on their freedom by the Chinese Communist Party. James refused to offer his own thoughts about China’s political policies at the time, saying that he had to do more research on the issue. Last January, Kanter told Fox News that a teammate of James had approached him and told him to keep applying pressure on James. Kanter, a former first-round pick by the Jazz in the 2011 draft, had stints with the Thunder, Knicks, Trail Blazers and Celtics before Boston traded him to the Rockets in February 2022.  Four days later, Kanter was waived by Houston and later alleged that it was due to his views about the Chinese government.  In August, Freedom told The Post that he believed he is being blackballed by the NBA due to his outspoken criticism of the league’s relationship with China. At the time, he said he did not receive a single offer over the summer in free agency.  “I knew there was a price to pay. And I don’t regret my actions,” Freedom said. “These things are bigger than me, bigger than the NBA, and bigger than basketball. While I am playing in the USA, people are being killed all over the world or imprisoned or tortured in prisons. If this is the sacrifice I need to make, I am ready to live with it.”  NBA commissioner Adam Silver denied that Freedom is being blackballed while speaking to the New York Times last March.

Enes Freedom,Ex NBA star Enes Kanter has $500K Turkish bounty on his head,https://nypost.com/2023/01/12/ex-nba-star-enes-kanter-has-500k-turkish-bounty-on-his-head/,"Former NBA star Enes Kanter Freedom — who famously amended his name after becoming a US citizen in 2021 — is officially a wanted man. Not only is his name on 2023’s most-wanted terrorists list, but this is the first time his former country has actually placed a published bounty on people’s heads. President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan’s government is offering up to 10 million Turkish Lira, or roughly $500,000, for information leading to the capture of Freedom, who said he found out about it a week ago. “That makes it so dangerous,” Freedom, 30, told The Post. “Before the bounty, Turkish intelligence were after the people on the list, but now everyone is after them because they want the money.” He also revealed that he is looking into suing the NBA — “I’m waiting for the right time” — which Freedom claims has blackballed him for his public protests against China. During 11 seasons in the NBA, Freedom was known for his outspokenness, including against the Turkish government’s human rights abuses. He has called out Erdoğan for being a “dictator,” stepped on a photo of him at a protest, and even dubbed him the “Hitler of our century.”  “Because of my platform, whenever I say something, it goes everywhere and the Turkish government hates that,” Freedom said. “They’re really sick of it, and they said ‘enough is enough’ and are doing whatever they can to shut me up.” The athlete’s name appears on the Turkish Terrorist Wanted List along with actual terrorists and fellow dissidents critical of the Erdoğan regime, which has routinely defied international human rights law. The list also names more than a dozen journalists — part of a larger assault on the free press in Turkey, where the number of jailed journalists has doubled in the past year. Although Freedom, who now lives in Washington, DC, admitted the bounty ups his personal security concerns, he said is in constant contact with local law enforcement and the FBI.  “I’m being protected 24/7,” he said, adding that he is more worried for the safety of the lesser-known Turkish dissidents on Erdoğan’s list. “I’m speaking out because I am not the only one on that list,” Freedom said of the bounty. “There are so many journalists, so many activists, and so many athletes, but they aren’t as well-known as me. They are way easier targets — and they’re alone out there.” The Swiss-born, Turkish-raised, American citizen has played for the New York Knicks, the Boston Celtics and other teams during his time in the NBA. But he caused a rift in the league — which pulls in billions of dollars in revenue from China via nearly half a billion viewers — when he became an outspoken critic of Xi Jinping and the Chinese Communist Party. He’s also been critical of Nike — a major NBA advertiser and player sponsor — for its manufacturing deals in China.  Freedom became known for wearing sneakers with messages like “Free Tibet,” “Free Uyghur,” and “No Beijing 2022,” painted by dissident artists, during games and has said he was pressured by the league to take off his shoes and keep his mouth shut. His refusal to do so led to a tiff with NBA star LeBron James in 2019. “I tweeted that Hong Kong should be free. [Then] Le Bron said he is not educated enough about the situation [to comment on it] and that what I tweeted hurt the league,” Freedom told The Post in 2021. “It’s sad that these players are social justice warriors, but, when it comes to China, they are scared to say anything …  Your values are more important than any money you can ever make from China.” Now, Freedom says he’s been blackballed by the NBA. After being traded to the Houston Rockets from the Boston Celtics in February, he was quickly dropped. He averaged 11.7 minutes, 3.7 points and 4.6 rebounds last season. “The NBA is never going to admit it, but I believe I’m being blackballed,” he told The Post. “I’ve had many conversations and everyone is saying the same thing: ‘Your career has ended because of your China comments.’” Now, Freedom is “waiting for the right time” to sue the league. “They are a 100% American made organization, but they are being controlled and run by the biggest dictatorship in the world, China,” he said. “How can China fire an American citizen from an American organization? That is unacceptable.”  “The league office has had no involvement in team roster decisions involving Mr. Freedom,” NBA spokesman Mike Bass told The Post. NBA commissioner Adam Silver, speaking with the New York Times this past March, denied that Kanter is being blackballed. “We spoke directly about his activities this season,” Silver said at the time. “and I made it absolutely clear to him that it was completely within his right to speak out on issues that he was passionate about.” Since leaving the NBA, he is running interfaith basketball camps for children to foster unity and has been traveling the world to meet with leaders as a human rights activist.  Although 2023 is the first year Freedom appeared on the Terrorist Wanted List, his conflict with the Turkish government is ongoing. Leaders revoked his passport in 2017 and requested an Interpol “red notice” — asking law enforcement worldwide to arrest pending extradition — in 2019. His father, Mehmet, was jailed in Turkey, and the family was forced to disown Freedom for their own safety, the athlete said. It’s been nearly 10 years since he spoke to them—and yet they are still being harassed back in Turkey, according to Freedom. “My dad went to a market, and people spit on his face,” he said. “And my mom can’t walk outside freely because she gets harassed.” Freedom said he hopes to call attention to the Turkish government’s cruelty. “I really want to show the world what kind of person Erdoğan is. Western leaders are not doing enough. They’re playing softball with this dictatorship,” Freedom said. “Diplomacy is important, but on the other side of the world people are losing their lives, their homes and their loved ones.”  Advertisement"
Joakim Noah,Joakim Noah relishes first Manila visit,https://www.rappler.com/sports/nba/joakim-noah-relishes-first-philippines-visit-2024/," SUMMARY This is AI generated summarization, which may have errors. For context, always refer to the full article. 
						BIG MAN. Joakim Noah leads a Jr. NBA and WNBA clinic in Manila, Philippines.					 
						NBA Philippines					 MANILA, Philippines – The Filipinos’ incomparable passion for basketball once again captivated a visitor, this time former NBA big man Joakim Noah. The two-time NBA All-Star stayed in the country for about a week, doing various activities like serving as a global liquor brand ambassador, playing pickup basketball, and teaching the next generation of Filipino hoopers. “I didn’t get to see the professional leagues, but it was very interesting to see being out here and seeing how much the people in Manila really love basketball,” Noah told Rappler in an exclusive interview. “There’s a real resilience and a competitive spirit. We even played a pickup game the other day. So I definitely felt that energy from the people,” he added. “You could feel that basketball is really part of the culture.” Noah, the 2014 NBA Defensive Player of the Year, is known mostly for his time with the Chicago Bulls, helping the team during a short revival of the franchise powered by Derrick Rose. The Bulls, one of the more popular franchises in the Philippines owing to their six championships in the 1990s, continue to attract fans. As soon as he arrived from a 30-hour flight, Noah received a warm welcome from Filipinos, with the 6-foot-11 center signing autographs and gamely posing for photos. “I’m almost 40 years old and I haven’t played in a professional game in almost five years,” said Noah, who last played professionally with the Los Angeles Clippers in 2020. “And to see that the people still know the Chicago Bulls from when I was playing there 10 years ago, I feel really blessed to be here.” Noah concluded his stay in the Philippines by leading the joint Junior NBA and WNBA camp at the Gatorade Hoops Center in Mandaluyong City on Sunday, June 30. Guiding 50 teenage boys and girls, Noah was joined by Natalia Andre, an ex-pro basketball player herself. Noah also led the unveiling of the refurbished CCP Bukaneg Court located just behind the main building of the Cultural Center of the Philippines in Pasay City on Friday, June 28. The court, renovated by French cognac distiller Hennessy, is part of the company’s global initiative dubbed “In the Paint.” It was designed by local artist Kiefer “Kiefsix” Indiongco, who used indigenous elements in the color scheme. He also designed the Nike Courtyard in Taguig City, which was opened in 2023. “[Noah’s] a huge cultural activist. He’s an art enthusiast himself. He does a lot of community work and authentic collaboration with us,” program head Pascale Kalambaie said. “He does a lot of work in Africa, across the US and Asia as well, so he’s a great ambassador as well.” – Rappler.com

Sports After signing a historic $304 million extension, Jaylen Brown set out on a valiant goal. He wanted to bring back ‘Black Wall Street’ in Boston. Living up to his vows, Brown launched Boston XChange, an initiative to help empower underserved communities and bridge the vast wealth gaps in the city. But why stop at Boston? Only days after the Boston initiative, Brown, in collaboration with Dallas Maverick’s head coach Jason Kidd has launched the Oakland XChange. The aim remains the same, to improve the community and help upscale underrepresented businesses. To do so, the reigning Finals rivals let their common love for Oakland make possible the launch of the empowerment initiative. Through the Oakland XChange, Jaylen Brown and Kidd hope to raise $5 billion to assist the community and its businesses by providing the resources and knowledge necessary to grow their projects. Additionally, they are also partnering with Oakstop, an organization that has worked to develop the Oakland community over the past 10 years. ADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad     A post shared by NBPA (@thenbpa)  Their primary motive is to raise sufficient funds to buy real estate assets that will be dedicated as space for creator businesses. “Giving resources back to our community and allowing them to have opportunities, I think, is key. The wealth gap is widening in other places of the US, not just Boston, so to be able to invest in our community is important,” said Jaylen Brown, an alumnus of the University of California. Jason Kidd also celebrated the initiative as an ‘off-court championship’ in partnership with Brown. The Hall of Fame point guard is a native of Oakland and has invested heavily in the community. ADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad While it’s been a busy week for Jaylen Brown, it has been a memorable one for Team USA. Both the men’s and women’s basketball teams that traveled to Paris achieved the expected gold medals. Likewise, the NBA community was bursting with pride. Brown’s teammates, Jayson Tatum, Derrick White, and Jrue Holiday all were a part of the gold medal roster. But even then, probably alluding to his ongoing rift with USAB, Jaylen Brown didn’t release any statement over the team’s Paris success. In the past, the Celtics Finals MVP has criticized the board for excluding him from the squad. Furthermore, he went as far as igniting a war with Nike, pinning them for his snub. ADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad However, despite getting off on the wrong foot, team director Grant Hill has left the door open for Jaylen Brown to join the 2028 Olympic team when the competition will be held in Los Angeles. The 27-year-old community leader is yet to have made his allegiance clear. But after Tatum’s lackluster Paris experience, there is a chance the Boston pair decide against participating in 2028.

Jarvis Landry,Former Alabama QB Bryce Young signs endorsement deal with Jordan Brand,https://theathletic.com/4456688/2023/04/27/bryce-young-jordan-brand-contract/,"NFL Former Alabama quarterback Bryce Young is signing an endorsement deal with Jordan Brand, the Nike company announced Thursday. Here’s what you need to know: The Athletic’s instant analysis: Jordan Brand has purposefully maintained a small roster of NFL players ever since Randy Moss became their first signee in 1999 as part of an effort to maintain a sense of exclusivity about the group. With that being said, they’ve recently expanded their presence in the NFL in response to swelling interest from players. Advertisement Jordan Retro cleats have become increasingly popular and, as more notable NFL players such as Davante Adams, Dak Prescott and Cam Jordan, among others, have signed with Jordan Brand, their overall footprint in the sport ranging from youth football to high school football to college football has made significant growth. That’s reflected in Jordan Brand bringing Young on board. Young assuredly had no shortage of options to choose from for a shoe endorsement deal and ultimately chose to roll with a company known for basketball. Young, who’ll only be 22 this season, is one of just two quarterbacks signed to Jordan Brand alongside Prescott, who’ll turn 30 in July. It’s not guaranteed, obviously, but Young has a shot to become the face of Jordan Brand’s football division moving forward if he lives up to the hype. — Reed (Photo courtesy of Jordan Brand) Get all-access to exclusive stories.

Zion Williamson,"Cooper Flagg might be great at Duke, but the best part for college hoops is A.J.

NORTH AUGUSTA, S.C. -- I remember coming to this gym the past two years and realizing that this rumored-about kid from middle-of-nowhere Maine was not only the real deal on the court, but had the potential to become one of the cooler stories we've seen in basketball in the past 20 years.  Cooper Flagg, of course.  And if you've been following basketball in general over the past few weeks, you realize that Flagg's time has officially come, months before he plays a game for Duke. While chatting in chilly gyms in recent days at the Nike Peach Jam, I remembered how much of Flagg's origin story came from the courts here at the Riverview Park Activities Center, where Nike's held its annual championship basketball event for close to 30 years. Before Flagg became the latest Next Big Thing, he was a rising fascination in high school circles. He's since morphed from fascination to sensation.  Who knows what awaits him in the next nine months at Duke. Nevertheless, college basketball has a bona fide star regardless of not yet having played a Division I game. The build-up for that media sensationalism (some of it clickbait, but a lot of justified due to Flagg's obvious ability and potential) begins at this level, at these events. He'll be a freshman that matters in a way nobody has since another Dukie: Zion Williamson. The best freshman in the country last season was Reed Sheppard, who was no doubt adored by Kentucky fans and a well-known talent ... but he also only started five games because of John Calipari's stubbornness. Even as the national freshman of the year, Sheppard was somehow a Kentucky one-and-doner/top-three NBA pick who nonetheless couldn't break through to widespread national appeal.  Flagg will. So, why am I bringing up Flagg in a July recruiting column when he's no longer in high school? Because I just spent five days on the road talking to dozens of college coaches and NBA scouts, and here's the most exciting part: For as awesome as Flagg could/should be, there's a chance he won't even be the best freshman in college basketball over the next two seasons. By the end of the 2026-27 season, he might not even be the second or third-best. That's a great thing for the sport. The future is bright (particularly since G League Ignite is no longer around to lure away a handful of top-rated prospects annually).  College basketball doesn't need freshman stars in order to bring in big viewership, but boy do they help. And sports fans love something fresh and new. (I point you to none other than Paul Skenes in MLB.) Men's college basketball -- in a double-edged sword kind of way -- is unique in how it's boosted off star players who arrive with a blast and leave after just one year. No other sport is afflicted with this bittersweet arrangement.  But at least they're getting them, and folks, after spending some time on the road to see the next wave of players set to enter college basketball in 2025 and 2026, it sure seems like the next few years could be something special.  The biggest name of them all is the highest-rated player in high school, a rising senior named A.J. Dybantsa. The 6-foot-9 shooting guard/power wing is from Massachusetts, plays for the Oakland Soldiers on the Nike circuit and would appear to be one of the most gifted scorers to emerge from the prep ranks in the past 10-plus years. Flagg was regarded as one of the best prospects to come out of high school in a generation.  Dybantsa might be better.  That's not merely my projection. I spent five days in Rock Hill, South Carolina, and North Augusta and took in Adidas' 3SSB (Three-Stripe Select Basketball) championship event in addition to the Peach Jam. I informally polled about two dozen coaches and scouts at the Adidas and Nike events about which prospect they liked best: Flagg, Dybantsa or another irresistible talent, 2026 blue-chipper Tyran Stokes (all three being No. 1 in their respective classes). Dybantsa received more votes than Flagg and Stokes combined. Dybantsa and Stokes are playing together this week at Peach Jam with the Oakland Soldiers, providing a team-up so dominant, a championship run would land as no surprise. Here's an early glimpse of what they've done in North Augusta.  AJ Dybantsa and Tyran Stokes combine for 46 in a 23-point win to open up Peach Jam🔥Stokes: 25 PTS | 11 REB | 5 ASTDybantsa: 21 PTS | 10-18 FG pic.twitter.com/jK4cBQsEAV Dybantsa's scoring ability is outrageous. It's natural to wince at big statements made about teenagers, but here's the reality of what I heard at Peach Jam over the weekend from multiple evaluators: Dybantsa's offensive impact on the court at this level at this stage of his budding basketball career is akin to basically any of the best prospects to come through the ranks over the past 20 years. He's that good. He communicates with his teammates on basically every possession, has go-go-gadget limbs, loves the mid-range just as much as the 3 (and is efficient at both), and seems to have the ability to teleport from one spot to another in a flash.  ""I'm just a loud person,"" Dybantsa told me.  If there's one adjective to describe Dybantsa's game, loud feels as fitting a descriptor as any. He has a preternatural ability to affect every play. His presence is ever-present. He looks bigger/rangier than any 6-9 high school player I've seen. If he keeps on this path, he'll be the No. 1 pick in the 2026 draft. NBA scouts I talked to framed his potential, in a best-case scenario, as being a guy who will one day lead the NBA in scoring. We're still 16 months away from Dybantsa playing in a college uniform, but yes, in case you were even a little skeptical, he will be a college basketball player. ""He is definitely going to college,"" his father, Ace, told me.  So we've got that coming in college basketball in 2025-26, which is electrifying. As for where we'll see Dybantsa play next year, he said a trimmed list of ""five to seven schools"" will be publicized by the end of the month. As of now, the list of hopeful schools is more than a dozen long, including almost all the blue blood names you'd expect to be in there, in addition to the likes of Alabama, Auburn and BYU.  Dybantsa told me this process has ""been tough"" as he's adjusted to being a high-profile high school athlete, but the insulation in his recruitment provided by his parents has made a lot of his day-to-day much more manageable. He'll be tracked by scouts, fans and coaches, essentially daily, from now until the night he's picked in the draft. The hype has already begun, but it will most definitely increase between now and his college debut in November of 2025. The excitement about the future of basketball is not just with Dybantsa. The top of the 2025 class has immense potential -- and could have more impact in college hoops than any freshman group in five-plus years by the time they enroll. That's a big takeaway from a lot of people this July. In recent years, juniors and seniors have run the sport, harkening back to the way it was in the 1960s, 70s, 80s, 90s and into the 2000s.  Will that change a bit in 2024, 2025 and 2026? Remember, this upcoming season is the last in college basketball with the bonus COVID year for all players. Come 2025-26, we'll be back to normal, and the average age in the sport will downswing.  It could lead to multiple freshmen being impactful at an All-American level.  This class -- led by Dybantsa (wing) -- is also highlighted by Cameron Boozer (power forward) and Darryn Peterson (combo guard). At the top, some scouts think it could be an epic group for both college basketball and the NBA Draft. Toss in stud point guard Darius Acuff Jr. and big man Koa Peat to round out the top five in 2025, and you know what it feels like? A freshman class at the top end that could be as impactful as some of the late 2000s and 2010 years, when we had first-year players capable of not only being really good, but mattering on a national level and competing for national player of the year.   Freshmen have become less valued in the hyper-transfer portal era, and for the most part I think their impact stands to be more muted than we saw from 2006-2019. The top of the 2025 class seems different.  Boozer and his brother, Cayden, have been dominant players for their entire run in high school, be it on the summer circuit or in prep play. For all the Dybantsa hype, Boozer's considered by some to be a surer thing in college, where his role, knack for winning and reliability for playing his best against the best competition is considered tantalizing. Duke, Florida and Miami are considered the three schools with realistic chances to land the Boozer twins.  Cameron Boozer's productivity and translatable skills to the college level will have him entering the 2025-26 season with just as much intrigue as Dybantsa. Boozer had previously been linked with Flagg, due to being in the same class until Flagg reclassified, but we should see Boozer vs. Dybantsa at Peach Jam later this week, which would be among the more anticipated head-to-heads in the event's history. As for Peterson, who plays on the Adidas circuit, he's not as big as the other two ... but he might be just as strong. He has an NBA-ready body right now. Peterson cuts an impressive figure and has traits as a combo guard that make him almost impossible to guard at this level. Some think Peterson should be on the same tier as Boozer and Dybantsa, and after seeing him dominate in Rock Hill, I can't disagree. If he's really the third-best player in this class, then college basketball's freshman crop a year from now will probably be better than the terrific group we're getting this year in Flagg, Rutgers' duo of Ace Bailey and Dylan Harper, plus Baylor stud V.J. Edgecomb.  As multiple coaches and NBA scouts told me: If Dybantsa, Boozer and Peterson were all eligible for the 2024 draft, they all may well have gone in the top five. Dybantsa almost certainly would have been No. 1.  As I watched Boozer, Dybantsa, Peterson, Peat and others, I remembered how there is no shortage of cautionary tales when it comes to overhyping prospects. Let's keep that at front of mind, too. Not ALL of these guys are going to continue to grow, get better and turn into All-NBA players or top-10 college guys. But there is an accepted truth among pretty much everyone in basketball that the 2025 class is better than many we've seen in recent years.  What do we have to thank for that? More than anything: NIL. With G League Ignite gone and Overtime Elite now allowed to bring in players but still have them be eligible to play in college, college basketball is benefiting from star talent in a way that it hasn't in some time. From a star power perspective, it's entering into another really good era.  So if you thought Flagg's inbound season at Duke would be a one-year burst for college basketball, think again. He should be tremendous. But there's a good chance we see even better players. The future of college basketball for the next three years looks bright -- and poised to deliver on freshman star power in a way we haven't seen since Zion. That's a huge victory for American basketball across the board. © 2004-2024 CBS Interactive. All Rights Reserved. CBS Sports is a registered trademark of CBS Broadcasting Inc.

20230418_mjr_su5_018 Kevin Durant unpunished while Kawhi Leonard gets grilled—Is this fair treatment or blatant favoritism? Well, for weeks now, Kawhi Leonard’s withdrawal from Team USA has been a real head-scratcher. When the decision was initially announced, not many batted an eye as USA Basketball stated that it was a joint decision by them and the Clippers organization, keeping Kawhi’s health in consideration. However, Clippers President Lawrence Frank turned the tables claiming that they had nothing to do with the call. Meanwhile, Kevin Durant’s spot on the team never came under threat despite him being out with a strained calf. As the blame game began, it was widely believed that Nike had an influence on USA Basketball’s decision to replace Kawhi because of his tarnished relationship with the sneaker giants. Giving his thoughts about the whole incident on the Clips N Dip podcast, Clippers’ insider and media veteran Tomer Azarly believes the actual issue might be far more complicated than the Nike controversy, “He (Kawhi) wanted to play. The Clippers say he wanted to play. Team USA claims it was a joint effort. It just wasn’t really adding up. And I understand if there’s like Nike politics involved… I just don’t buy that as an easy excuse.” USA Today via Reuters Apr 26, 2024; Dallas, Texas, USA; LA Clippers forward Kawhi Leonard (2) warms up before the game between the Dallas Mavericks and the LA Clippers during game three of the first round for the 2024 NBA playoffs at the American Airlines Center. Mandatory Credit: Jerome Miron-USA TODAY Sports While Kawhi has a legal history with Nike as they battled for the copyright ownership of the ‘Klaw’ logo in 2019, there could be more underlying issues leading up to Kawhi’s withdrawal. Moreover, Azarly found it extremely strange that Kawhi wasn’t even given a chance to play a single showcase game even though he had been through four practice sessions in Las Vegas. “Not really giving him an opportunity to even get to one of the other countries and play a game, considering you have a guy on the sidelines who hasn’t played with a calf strain in a month now. It’s just strange to me.” Azarly added. If the issue was only about injury concerns, then Durant should have been treated the same as Kawhi as he had shown more visible signs of injury than Kawhi had until then. ADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad Is Kawhi Leonard being unfairly targeted while Kevin Durant gets a free pass? React! Reactions When Azarly pointed out USA Basketball’s double standards in a recent tweet, booting Kawhi early while keeping an injured KD on the squad, he made it clear that the tweet wasn’t meant as a shot at The Slim Reaper. “That was in no way a shot at Kevin Durant. Again, Kevin Durant is an all timer, he’s an Olympian. He deserves to have that chance to be there.” Azarly reiterated on the pod. But his only concern was why Kawhi wasn’t given the same opportunity when they could have assessed his fitness by playing him in the Showcase games and made a more sound decision. Moreover, Team USA head coach Steve Kerr made it clear that replacing Kevin Durant was never considered despite his injury, “Yeah, there’s no thought of replacing Kevin.” Surely something smells fishy. Doesn’t it? On top of all this, the Clippers insider also revealed that just a day after he asked Grant Hill about an update on Kawhi sometime around Game 2 of the NBA Finals when there was no talk of his withdrawal, Adrian Wojnarowski dropped a bomb revealing that Derrick White was already in consideration to replace the two-time Champion. “That’s a strange timing moment.” Tomer remarked. With so many factors involved and every party telling a different story, it’s nearly impossible to pinpoint the actual reason why Kawhi is not playing in the Paris Olympics. As Kanye said in his Grammy-winning speech, “I guess we’ll never know.” What are your thoughts?

Kawhi Leonard,Why Derrick White made more sense for Team USA than Jaylen Brown after Kawhi Leonard's withdrawal,https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/why-derrick-white-made-more-sense-for-team-usa-than-jaylen-brown-after-kawhi-leonards-withdrawal/,"If not listed, please contact your TV provider. Three Boston Celtics are playing for Team USA at the Paris Olympics. Jaylen Brown, widely considered the team's second-best player, is not among them. It didn't seem like much of a slight when the rosters were initially announced. The star-studded group had to make cuts somewhere when LeBron James, Stephen Curry and Kevin Durant all surprisingly agreed to play following the disappointment of the 2023 World Cup. Jayson Tatum still made the cut. Jrue Holiday would likely rank lower among all NBA players than Brown to most observers, but his stellar play for Team USA in Tokyo during the 2020 Olympics and his specialist skill set as a defensive ace made him a natural pick. Nobody called Brown a snub when the roster was announced during the season. But when Kawhi Leonard withdrew due to a knee issue, Brown appeared, on the surface, to be an obvious candidate to replace him. He plays the same position as Leonard and shares similar physical dimensions. He is coming off of his first NBA championship and is a reliable, All-Star-caliber player. He even played for Team USA before, back in the 2019 World Cup. Team USA didn't medal in that tournament, but Brown's performance was largely acceptable. In the end, though, Team USA chose Brown's Boston teammate, Derrick White, to replace Leonard. Brown seemingly didn't take that too well. When the news came out, he began tweeting cryptically. Eventually, he directed his ire towards Nike, the manufacturer of Team USA's uniforms. @nike this what we doing ? Brown is not currently signed to a sneaker deal anywhere, but had previously worn Adidas. However, in 2022, Brown criticized Nike founder Phil Knight for his treatment of Kyrie Irving after the then-Brooklyn Nets star shared an antisemitic film on social media. Knight said that Irving ""stepped over the line."" Brown responded by rhetorically asking, ""Since when did Nike care about ethics?"" Nike cut ties with Irving soon after. Team USA executive director Grant Hill pushed back on the idea that Nike was any sort of factor in the decision to add White over Brown. ""For a good portion of my career, I wore Fila,"" Hill joked. ""That was supposed to be a joke. We're proud of our partners, obviously, USA Basketball. This is about putting together a team."" Putting together a team on the FIBA stage is an entirely different process than doing so in the NBA. Think about the sheer degree of competition for talent in the pros and the constraints the salary cap creates when assembling it. In the NBA, loading your team with star power means having three or four big names. But Team USA? Even in a weak year, it's generally feasible for the Americans to send 12 All-Stars to the Olympics. When you have that degree of talent, the things you need change drastically. Think about Brandon Ingram. He was supposed to be one of the faces of Team USA at the World Cup last year. He largely proved unplayable. In hindsight, that made plenty of sense. Ingram's best trait by far is his one-on-one scoring ability. He can make hard shots. There are a finite number of players in the world who can reliably do so. In the NBA, when 30 teams are fighting for 100% of that player pool, getting even one of them is a major coup. But Team USA has access to 80-90% of them at any given time... and is only fielding one roster. Suddenly, taking and making hard shots becomes less important when Jalen Brunson, Anthony Edwards, Mikal Bridges, Paolo Banchero and Tyrese Haliburton are also on the team. What you need under those circumstances are players who do everything else. Josh Hart isn't nearly as accomplished at the NBA level as Ingram. He was a significantly more important part of Team USA's World Cup bid last summer because he makes his living doing the dirty work. ""People ask, 'What position does he play?' He plays winner,"" head coach Steve Kerr said last summer. Team USA wants players like this. That is why Tayshaun Prince and Andre Iguodala have gold medals right now. Brown, emphatically, is not Ingram. Ingram's defense is theoretical most of the time. Brown is a reliably strong defender. He's no star playmaker, but he was just among the higher-usage players on the most efficient offense in NBA history. He can function within a team setting, clearly. But a lot of the appeal of having Jaylen Brown is his scoring. Remove it from the equation as something Team USA simply doesn't need and White starts to look more appealing. White, by virtue of his experience as a point guard, is the superior playmaker. He shot better from 3-point range last season. He's earned All-Defense honors two seasons in a row. Brown has never made an All-Defense team. Perhaps more importantly, White has never made an All-Star Team. Unlike Brown, he wasn't a high-lottery pick or a high recruit. He spent most of his college career playing Division II ball and didn't arrive in the NBA as a starter. This means nothing in the NBA. It's potentially important in an Olympic setting featuring so much star power. The reality of building an American Olympic roster is that there aren't enough minutes or shots for everybody. Neither Brown nor White was ever going to get much run in the Leonard slot because neither is as good as Leonard. Team USA credibly could have started or closed games with him. Even if it hadn't, Leonard has genuinely competed for the title of ""best player in the NBA."" So have the other players at his position. LeBron James and Kevin Durant are higher priorities here than whoever gets the 12th roster spot. There is always a player or two sitting at the end of the bench as a ""break glass in case of emergency option."" It's imperative that Team USA fills those slots with players who aren't going to let their egos get the better of them. This isn't to suggest that Brown has any sort of bad reputation within locker rooms. He's just so accomplished as a player that he'd probably arrive at Team USA expecting to play a meaningful role because he's never not played a meaningful role on any team he's been a part of. White has been a role player all his life. If he's just here to practice hard and cheer from the sidelines, then there's little doubt that he's going to practice hard and cheer from the sidelines. There are worlds in which he's asked to do more than that. This tournament, strategically speaking, is geared much more toward guards than wings. Remember, Luka Doncic and Slovenia just got knocked out before qualifying. Most of the other best wings in the world are American. But Germany just won the World Cup with Dennis Schroder as by far its leading scorer. Canada is the only team in the field with multiple perimeter stars, and both Shai Gilgeous-Alexander and Jamal Murray are guards. There are even less famous players on the NBA stage that morph into megastars in FIBA play. Patty Mills has averaged over 21 points per game in Olympic play for his career. He's never been a full-time starter in the NBA. Defensive guards, in this field, are more important than defensive wings. Team USA's job is not to simply assemble the 12 most talented players available. Frankly, if it was, Brown would probably miss out anyway. Donovan Mitchell isn't on the team. Neither is Jalen Brunson or Damian Lillard or Paul George or Zion Williamson. Almost any American All-Star could construct a gripe if he really wanted to. The difference between, say, the 15th and 21st best player in the NBA is pretty small. It's Team USA's job to put together the group of 12 players who, combined, give it the best chance at winning gold. Sometimes that means grabbing the most accomplished player on the board. Sometimes that means identifying a specialist that makes sense in the context of the other 11 players and the 11 other teams it will face in the tournament. That thought process led Kerr and Hill to White over Brown, and it was the right decision. © 2004-2024 CBS Interactive. All Rights Reserved.

Dennis Rodman,"Vanessa Bryant, Magic Johnson, and More Celebrate as Dennis Rodman’s Daughter Wins 1st Olympic Gold With Team USA",https://www.essentiallysports.com/nba-legends-basketball-news-soccer-news-vanessa-bryant-magic-johnson-and-more-celebrate-as-dennis-rodmans-daughter-wins-first-olympic-gold-with-team-usa/,"More Sports ES Fancast Aug 10, 2024 | 11:49 PM EDT via Imago Credits: IMAGO via Imago Credits: IMAGO Trinity Rodman wins gold—Is she surpassing her father's legendary legacy already? The mood at the Rodman household must be electric right now. After all, Trinity Rodman, daughter of NBA legend Dennis Rodman, just helped the U.S. women’s national soccer team clinch their first Olympic gold medal in 12 years. Certainly, the basketball fraternity wouldn’t miss out on recognizing the feat and the talent. On August 10, in a game that kept everyone on the edge of their seats, the U.S. defeated Brazil 1-0. The first and only goal of the game came from Mallory Swanson, one of the three on the new coach, Emma Hayes’ front three alongside Sophia Smith and Rodman. Earlier this week, Trinity Rodman, Swanson, and Smith appeared on TODAY, where they proudly introduced their new moniker, ‘Triple Espresso.’ 5× NBA champion’s daughter explained, “We have a proposal for our trio name to be ‘Triple Espresso.’ So we’re going to put that out into the air and let people run with that, because we like that as well.” Although fans and players have also given the trio nicknames like “The Trident” and “Holy Trinity,” it’s clear that ‘Triple Espresso’ is the name that is sticking with them. ADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad However, it wasn’t just ‘Triple Espresso’ that made this victory possible. Goalkeeper Alyssa Naeher delivered a game-saving performance, especially with a one-handed save on Adriana’s header in stoppage time. This marked the third occasion where the U.S. emerged victorious against Brazil in an Olympic final, with previous wins in 2004 in Athens and 2008 in Beijing. Did Dennis Rodman's daughter just make her dad proud or what? React! Reactions Watching the moment live were Mission Impossible star Tom Cruise and former U.S. soccer star Megan Rapinoe herself. But celebrations were certainly not limited to courtside. As the US women’s soccer team secured only the 5th Olympic medal of the program, USA hype-man this Summer Games and Dennis Rodam’s brief rival, Magic Johnson, were quick to jump in to congratulate.“Congratulations to the US Women’s Soccer team on beating Brazil to win the gold this morning!!🥇” he wrote on X. Congratulations to the US Women’s Soccer team on beating Brazil to win the gold this morning!!🥇 — Earvin Magic Johnson (@MagicJohnson) August 10, 2024 Expand Tweet  Rodam, who shared the court with Kobe Bryant in 1999, also saw the LA Lakers‘ icon’s widow, Venessa, extending her cheers over the win – keeping alive not just the Kobe-Dennis bond but also the one he shared with his daughter. Posting an image of Trinity Rodman and her teammates on her Instagram story, she captioned, “GOLD.”  Kobe left a huge impact on Trinity when he reminded her that “women are capable of being as successful, if not more successful, than men.” She revealed that it motivated her to continue playing soccer. She had seemingly met Kobe through his daughter Natalia, whom she played on the same team with as a six-year-old. So the eldest of the Bryant daughters also celebrated the win, posting a photo of the ‘Triple Espresso’ trio with their gold medals. ADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad But the NBA ties don’t end there. Actress Gabrielle Union, wife of 3× NBA champion Dwyane Wade, also took to Instagram to praise the gold-winning team. She shared a stat graphic highlighting how the team has returned to its winning ways. Finally, back in the Rodman family, Trinity’s brother, Dennis Rodman Jr., who is following in his father’s footsteps by playing college basketball at USC, shared an image of Trinity and her teammates, captioning it, “Gold for you!! @trinity_rodman.” Trinity ended her Olympic run with three goals, one assist, and tallying 46 caps for the senior team.

Florida. (Photo by MediaPunch/Bauer-Griffin/GC Images) Can you believe Dennis Rodman, with all his fame, is worth only $500K? What went wrong? Dennis Rodman’s signature shoes once outsold his former teammate Michael Jordan‘s Air Jordan! That was his level of popularity. Fans still love the shoe for its unique design. Apart from Nike, the Worm signed deals with Reebok as well. He had a successful life both on and off the court as he earned millions until everything went off the rails. His net worth took a hit and dropped to $500,000. However, he still earns benefits from numerous of his initiatives. After his last stint at the Chicago Bulls, the NBA legend played for one year with the Lakers and then joined the Dallas Mavericks. However, his playing time with the Mavs wasn’t long either. After playing 12 games, Rodman left the Mavericks in 2000 and took a long break from the sport. Selected as the 3rd pick, he played for 5 teams in the NBA and earned about $27 million. During the 1997-98 season, he was the tenth highest-paid NBA player. Here is how Rodman managed to maintain $500,000 after losing millions to a scam. ADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad Apart from his NBA career, Rodman also ventured into other opportunities such as movies and TV Shows. He featured in films like Double Team, Jean-Claude Van Damme, Simon Sez (1999), Cutaway (2000), and more. This was in the year 1997. He also starred in the first season of VH1’s reboot of The Surreal Life. Most fans might remember him in the special reality show “The Rodman World Tour,” which premiered on MTV. He also made a guest appearance in the TV show, 3rd Rock from the Sun. As mentioned above, Rodman’s shoe deals significantly boosted his net worth and the Converse endorsement deal was more important. Back in 2013, he cleverly tapped into his “Bad Boy” fame and marketed his new vodka brand, ‘Original Bad Ass Premium Vodka’ which was launched in 2013. In 2015, he parted ways with his financial advisor Peggy Ann Fulford, who, reportedly, scammed him. Rodman lost millions to this scam. “It makes me sad I trusted someone I considered family to manage my money, and they did terribly wrong. I hope other athletes and celebrities can learn from this experience,” Rodman said, talking about his former advisor. In 2018, the veteran was seen promoting cryptocurrency, PotCoin. Dennis Rodman ventured into professional wrestling as well, in the late 1990s. He has been part of several high-profile matchups, including bouts with Hulk Hogan. The most iconic of his wrestling matchups was the July 1998 Bash at the Beach event where he battled against Karl Malone which he won again. via Getty LOS ANGELES, CA – JULY 14: Dennis Rodman attends the Comedy Central Roast of Bruce Willis at Hollywood Palladium on July 14, 2018 in Los Angeles, California. (Photo by Rich Fury/Getty Images) After retiring from wrestling, the Detroit Pistons legend was not very active in professional sport for a few years before he started playing in the overseas Basketball leagues in 2003. He played for the Long Beach Jam, Orange County Crush, Tijuana Dragons, and Brighton Bears. The 5x NBA champ saw massive popularity while playing for the Brighton Bears in the British Basketball League. He even made an appearance in season 4 of the celebrity show, Big Brother.

He then made a comeback to wrestling in Hulk Hogan’s Celebrity Championship Wrestling in 2008. Earnings from his books also boosted Dennis Rodman’s net worth. He has written several books including Bad As I Wanna Be, Dennis the Wild Bull, and more. While all these endeavors contributed to the rise in his earnings, Rodman couldn’t recover enough to get back to his initial net worth which was in the millions in the 90s.

					By Matt Grobar  Senior Film Reporter Ben Affleck and Matt Damon are reteaming for a Nike drama that Affleck will direct for Amazon Studios, Skydance Sports and Mandalay Pictures, Deadline can confirm. The as-yet-untitled sports marketing film will tell the incredible story of how Sonny Vaccaro (Damon), a maverick sneaker salesman, led a fledgling running shoe company called Nike in its pursuit of the most transformative athlete in the history of sports: Michael Jordan. Affleck will portray Nike co-founder Phil Knight in the story surrounding Nike’s longshot effort to sign Jordan to its shoe company in the mid-’80s, an endorsement that seemed impossible at the time but which would become the most significant relationship between an athletic brand and an athlete and launched the global, multibillion-dollar contemporary sneaker industry.

 Sonny’s relentless quest to sign Jordan to what was then the third-place shoe company takes him to Jordan’s parents, and in particular his powerful, dynamic mother, as well as to former coaches, advisors, friends and those close to Michael. Jordan himself is a giant mythic figure hovering above the movie and never seen, while Sonny tries to reach him by gaining access to those close to him and around him.

 Alex Convery wrote the original script, titled Air Jordan, which was named to the 2021 Black List of the best unproduced screenplays. Mandalay brought it to Skydance Sports president Jon Weinbach, who then secured Vaccarro’s life rights. Affleck and Damon are doing a new pass on the script and will produce alongside Peter Guber and Jason Michael Berman of Mandalay Pictures. While Affleck has never before directed Damon, the pair famously co-wrote and starred together in Gus Van Sant’s 1997 film Good Will Hunting, which won them an Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay. They also recently reteamed for Ridley Scott’s film The Last Duel, starring there alongside Adam Driver, Jodie Comer and more. Affleck previously directed films including Gone Baby Gone, The Town, Best Picture Oscar winner Argo and Live by Night. He recently starred opposite Ana de Armas in the erotic thriller Deep Water and will next be seen in The Flash and Robert Rodriguez’s thriller Hypnotic. Other upcoming films featuring Damon include Taika Waititi’s Thor: Love and Thunder and Christopher Nolan’s Oppenheimer.  








 Regularly featuring on the Black List, Convery has been behind such screenplays as Bag Mag, Excelsior! and Wild Things.

Credit: Kyle Terada-USA TODAY Sports Is Jaylen Brown's controversy a sign of deeper issues within the team? USA basketball’s managing director, Grant Hill, has been caught in a wave of controversies since the Olympics began. It started with Jaylen Brown‘s exclusion from the squad, and then Jayson Tatum not receiving enough playing time during the Olympic games. Even though Hill said that he would consider Brown in the 2028 Olympic squad, things have not cooled down yet. Team USA went to the Olympics with a star-studded lineup, which comprised 12 players top-tier NBA players. Yes, they won the gold, but it was not all sunshine and rainbows behind the scenes. With that much talent, not everyone got the minutes they wanted – even the big names from the NBA squads. Just look at Jayson Tatum-he ended up with multiple DNPs, as he sat out two whole games with no playing time and not everyone was happy with it. In light of that, veteran NBA analyst Brian Windhorst advised Grant Hill to pick the young players going ahead, to avoid all the drama. The idea is to start developing the young players specifically for FIBA competitions and to build a squad that is down to stick together through a few summers, leading up to big events like the 2028 Olympics. “I don’t necessarily think it’s the worst idea in the world to take all young guys to the World Cup. Like, do what they do in soccer of the Olympics and say, we are gonna take all 23 and under,” Windhorst mentioned on the ESPN podcast. ADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad “Because we[Team USA] are gonna start developing FIBA players. We are gonna say, ‘hey, commit to playing in the summer in 2026, commit to playing the summer in 27′ and you are not promised for 28’ but let’s see where it leads. Maybe there shouldn’t be, in spots 11 and 12, maybe there shouldn’t be star players there. Maybe there should be FIBA players, NBA players, don’t get me wrong, but FIBA players who have played for multiple summers in a row,” the media vet further added. Is Jaylen Brown's controversy a ticking time bomb for Team USA? React! Reactions Windhorst wants Team USA to create a crew that’s more in sync with international play. After all, it’s all about long-term growth and commitment, not just banking on NBA stars. Talking about NBA stars though, what’s been brewing between Grant Hill and Jaylen Brown? Let’s dive deep. It was not that long ago that Jaylen Brown took a shot at Team USA and Nike, letting everyone know he was not cool with Team USA picking his Celtics teammate, Derrick White, as Kawhi Leonard‘s replacement instead of him. The current finals MVP tweeted, “@nike this what we doing.” Brown was probably implying it was Nike that kept him off the Team USA roster. ADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad In response, Hill said, “And, so, whatever theories that might be out there, they’re just that. But that’s my responsibility. And it’s tough. It’s tough to have conversations, tell people that they’re not on the team.” Jaylen Brown did not take too kindly to being called a conspiracy theorist by the USAB managing director, as he shot back, stating, “Grant Hill calling me a conspiracy theorist is disappointing. I’ve been a VP [of the NBPA] since I was 21 years old, I have a great understanding.” However, Grant Hill now wants to squash the beef. He is even open to having Brown on the Team USA squad in the 2028 Olympics. “It’s a lot of noise. I’m confident he and I will sit down at some point and talk about it and get to some level of understanding. He’ll be a candidate, if he wants, in 2028. One thing I’ve learned, you can’t take anything personally in this role. I haven’t personalized anything. My objective, my goal, is to win. And as soon as, hopefully, that happens, we pivot and start looking ahead to the future,” Hill said. As this might have been the last season for many of the veteran players in the Olympics, there will probably be space for Jaylen Brown on the Team USA roster for the 2028 Olympics. But the question is, after all that has happened, will Brown accept the offer to be a part of Team USA? What are your thoughts?

Grant Hill,USA Basketball: Grant Hill says Jaylen Brown will be considered for 2028 Olympics after omission in Paris,https://www.cbssports.com/olympics/news/usa-basketball-grant-hill-says-jaylen-brown-will-be-considered-for-2028-olympics-after-omission-in-paris/,"If not listed, please contact your TV provider. USA Basketball director Grant Hill hopes to clear the air with Boston Celtics forward Jaylen Brown. Brown took issue with not being selected as a replacement on the 2024 Paris Olympics roster after Kawhi Leonard withdrew from the team. Team USA elected to choose Brown's Celtics teammate Derrick White for the open roster spot, leading to Brown calling out USA Basketball and Nike, the official apparel brand for Team USA.  Brown implied on social media that Nike was the reason he was kept off the team, to which Hill responded at the time, saying in part, ""Whatever theories that might be out there, they're just that. But that's my responsibility. And it's tough. It's tough to have conversations, tell people that they're not on the team.""  Brown then shot back on social media, calling out Hill, saying, ""Grant Hill calling me a conspiracy theorist is disappointing. I've been a VP [of the NBPA] since I was 21 years old I have a great understanding.""  While the dust had settled on the situation since the Olympics started, Hill said on the Open Run podcast with Rachel Nichols that he hopes to talk with Brown and that he will be considered for the 2028 Los Angeles Olympics.  ""When you have a team with the profile of players on this team, you know there's going to be controversy. You know that coming in, I knew that. I think what people fail to realize is I'm a fan of basketball, and I'm a fan of these guys that are playing in the current era...My whole approach is to celebrate the greatness of today's players. So yeah it was disappointing. You gotta do your job, I've tried to do this the right way. When we first put out the roster back in April, before it was announced, I called certain guys. I called Paul George, Damian Lillard, Jaylen Brown, I felt like they were of a certain stature where they deserved to hear it before it was made public. And I appreciated their willingness to want to be a part of this, but also wanted them to appreciate just how difficult this was. To me that was leading with integrity, doing the right thing, recognizing who they are, what they've meant to USA basketball in years past."" 	 ... 	 ""It's a lot of noise, I'm confident he and I will sit down at some point and talk about it and get to some level of understanding. He'll be a candidate, if he wants, in 2028. One thing I've learned, you can't take anything personal in this role. I haven't personalized anything, my objective, my goal is to win. And as soon as, hopefully, that happen, we pivot and start looking ahead to the future.""  Brown certainly has the resume to make the USA Basketball roster, especially after this season, during which he finished as an NBA champion and Finals MVP while leading the Celtics throughout the postseason to their first title since 2008. But making the roster for USA Basketball is the most difficult team to make, given all the talent. You could argue that he should've been named the replacement over White, but there were very good reasons to have White on the roster over Brown, too. While Team USA looks on pace to earn its fifth straight gold medal, the 2028 Olympics will be a total change of guard for the men's basketball team. LeBron James could be retired, and Kevin Durant and Stephen Curry will be 39 and 40 years old, respectively, so naturally, there will be more room for Brown to be on the roster. Hill sounds more than ready to bury the hatchet; we'll just have to see if Brown is willing to do the same. © 2004-2024 CBS Interactive. All Rights Reserved.

Grant Hill,Jaylen Brown will be a 'candidate' for Team USA in 2028,https://www.boston.com/sports/morning-sports-update/2024/08/08/jaylen-brown-grant-hill-team-usa-basketball-2028-roster/,"
								By Hayden Bird  Grant Hill on Jaylen Brown: While Team USA’s Olympic basketball experience has (so far) been smooth sailing, the conversation around the selection process has arguably become the most controversial point. Jaylen Brown, a pillar of the champion Celtics and the 2024 NBA Finals MVP, was omitted from the U.S. roster even after Kawhi Leonard was replaced shortly before the Games got underway. Brown was clearly disappointed in not being selected, insinuating that his past comments critical of Nike (the Team USA apparel sponsor) played a role in his exclusion. USA Basketball managing director Grant Hill has responded to Brown, saying that it was a not a “conspiracy theory” to pick other players, but was simply a basketball decision. Brown then answered by saying he found Hill’s conspiracy theory label as “disappointing.” The public back-and-forth has not been an ideal moment for both Brown and Hill. Asked about the situation by NBA reporter Rachel Nichols in an interview on Wednesday, Hill offered a summary from his perspective. “It’s been a learning [experience],” Hill began. “First of all, when you have a team with the profile of players on this team, you know there’s going to be controversy. So you know that coming in, and I knew that.” The U.S. roster is inevitably stacked with world-class talent, including three of Brown’s Celtics teammates (Jayson Tatum, Jrue Holiday, and Derrick White). Hill said that he believes in the idea that players in the current era are better than those from earlier times (including his own), giving him a usually positive view and experience with today’s NBA stars. As a result, the tough conversation around Brown has hurt. “It was disappointing,” Hill said of the situation with Brown. “You got to do your job. You got to do the job the best you can. I’ve tried to do this the right way. When we first put out the roster back in April — before it was announced — I called certain guys. I called Paul George. I called Damian Lillard. I called Jaylen Brown. “I felt like they were of a certain stature where they deserved to hear it before it was made public,” Hill added. “And I appreciated their willingness to want to be a part of this. But [I] also wanted them to appreciate how difficult this was.” Looking back on how he handled it, Hill still believes he managed the situation “with integrity.” As a result, he doesn’t view the “controversy” with Brown to be particularly deep-rooted. “It’s a lot of noise. I’m confident he and I will sit down at some point and talk about it and get to some level of understanding,” Hill said of Brown’s international team future. “Look, he’ll be a candidate if he wants in ’28.” Brown will be 31 at the time of the 2024 Summer Olympics, which will be held in Los Angeles. Hill is intent on keeping the door open. “One thing I learned, you can’t take anything personal in this role, and so I haven’t personalized anything,” Hill concluded. “My goal, my objective is to win. And then soon as hopefully that happens, we pivot and start looking ahead to the future.” Trivia: Grant Hill was named ACC men’s basketball Player of the Year in 1994 while playing for Duke.

Grant Hill,"Celtics conspiracy: Jaylen Brown vs Grant Hill in nasty war of words, while Steve Kerr refuses to play Jayson Tatum in USA Olympics blowout",https://talksport.com/sport/1985440/celtics-conspiracy-jaylen-brown-kerr-jayson-tatum-olympics/,"The reigning NBA champions are going through a period of public dysfunction. Jayson Tatum wasn't allowed on the court during Team USA's Olympic-opening 26-point blowout of Serbia on Sunday. And while Tatum was roadblocked by head coach Steve Kerr, Boston Celtics teammate Jaylen Brown is engaging in a nasty war of words with Grant Hill in public view. Hill, who entered the Naismith Hall of Fame in 2018, is currently the executive director for Team USA and directly involved in roster decisions. Barely a month after Tatum and Brown teamed up to lead the Celtics to an impressive 4-1 victory over the Dallas Mavericks in the NBA Finals, the Boston duo are either warring with Team USA or being blatantly ignored by the team. ""Grant hill calling me a conspiracy theorist is disappointing I’ve been a VP since I was 21 years old I have a great understanding,"" Brown tweeted. Brown, who is the vice president of the NBA Players Association, has suggested that Nike is at the core of the decision to leave him off the roster.  Hill fired back at Tatum, brushing off a suggestion that the veteran Celtic being left off Team USA's roster was due to a sports business conflict. ""This idea that there's a conspiracy theory -- I always love a good conspiracy theory, but it was really, truly a basketball decision,"" Hill said on The Dan Patrick Show.  ""These are tough decisions. But having gone through this with the FIBA competition, you want to find the right balance and the right pieces on the court that we needed.  ""And not to say that he wouldn't have been good -- there's a lot of guys, you could go on a list of guys who are very capable and very qualified, but, for where we were, it was the right decision. And Derrick White, I think, will help us as we pursue gold."" Brown is far superior to White on the court. Brown has has three All-Star selection and just won a first Finals MVP, while White -- who was called up just before the Olympics to replace an injured Kawhi Leonard -- has never made an All-Star team. But Jrue Holiday proved on Sunday the value of defensive-minded role players for Team USA, and not every All-Star can make the roster -- or the starting lineup.  Still, many NBA fans believe that Brown should be on the Olympic squad, while Tatum definitely should have been allowed on the court -- at least during garbage time. ""It's personal,"" one fan tweeted.  ""In the future, all NBA type players will ... will enjoy their summers and you can play with college kids again,"" a second fan posted. ""I can’t say I’d blame them. First team All NBA, MVP candidate of the NBA, best player on the champs and can’t find a (minute) in a 26 pt blowout?""

Grant Hill,Jaylen Brown hits back at Grant Hill over Olympics 'conspiracy theory' jab,https://nypost.com/2024/07/28/sports/jaylen-brown-hits-back-at-grant-hill-over-olympics-conspiracy-theory-jab/,"Jaylen Brown still isn’t over Team USA’s decision to leave him off the Olympic roster for the games in Paris, and the NBA champion took umbrage with the idea that he was peddling a conspiracy theory about why he wasn’t included.  USA Basketball managing director Grant Hill appeared on the “Dan Patrick Show” on Friday and explained the rationale behind Brown not being selected, yet his Celtics teammate Derrick White was.  Hill reiterated a stance that he had held for some time, that the decision came down to a basketball decision, and denied any conspiracy to keep Brown off the team because he wasn’t a Nike-sponsored athlete. That position seemed to set Brown off on Sunday and he took to social media to express that just as the U.S. men’s basketball team was tipping off against Serbia.  “grant hill calling me a conspiracy theorist is disappointing I’ve been a VP since I was 21 years old I have a great understanding,” Brown posted on X.  Nike is a sponsor of USA Basketball and the outfitter of the U.S. Olympic team and Brown has been critical of Nike over the years, including two years ago during a situation with Kyrie Irving after the athletic apparel brand dropped him.  And Brown, who was not signed with an apparel company after five years with Adidas to start his career, has made it clear he believes Nike conspired with Team USA to keep him from competing in these summer games  Earlier this month he was asked directly about it by a reporter. “I do, for sure. There be more stuff to come with that,” Brown said when asked if he felt Nike played a role in the decision. “As of now, I’m not going to comment on it.” Brown, the NBA Finals MVP, also posted directly to the company, “@nike this what we doing ?” He had another more cryptic post on X the following day.  “Im not afraid of you or your resources,” Brown wrote.  During Friday’s appearance on the “Dan Patrick Show,” Hill did say he had spoken to Brown’s agent about the decision.  “I don’t know if that was before or after things went out on Twitter,” Hill said. “But yeah, I think this idea that there’s a conspiracy theory — I always love a good conspiracy theory, but it was really truly a basketball decision and these are tough decisions. But having gone through this with the FIBA competition, you want to find the right balance and the right pieces on the court that we needed.”  Team USA defeated Serbia 110-84 on Sunday. "
Grant Hill,Jaylen Brown responds to Grant Hill's comments about Team USA roster 'conspiracy theories',https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/jaylen-brown-responds-to-grant-hills-comments-about-team-usa-roster-conspiracy-theories/,"If not listed, please contact your TV provider. Boston Celtics star Jaylen Brown did not like Grant Hill's recent comments about USA Basketball's decision to replace Kawhi Leonard with Derrick White (and not Brown) on the men's national team for the Paris Olympics: grant hill calling me a conspiracy theorist is disappointing I’ve been a VP since I was 21 years old I have a great understanding Hill, the managing director of Team USA (which opened Olympic play Sunday against Serbia), said in an interview on ""The Dan Patrick Show"" on Friday that he'd spoken to Brown's agent about the choice. ""I don't know if that was before or after things went out on Twitter,"" Hill said. ""But yeah, I mean, I think this idea that there's a conspiracy theory -- I always love a good conspiracy theory, but it was really, truly a basketball decision. These are tough decisions, but having gone through this with the FIBA competition, you want to find the right balance and the right pieces on the court that we needed. And not to say that he wouldn't have been good -- there's a lot of guys, you could go on a list of guys who are very capable and very qualified, but, for where we were, it was the right decision. And Derrick White, I think, will help us as we pursue gold."" After the announcement, Brown's posts on social media made it clear he thought Nike had played a nefarious role. At the ESPY Awards on July 11, he declined to elaborate. At summer league in Las Vegas on July 15, when asked directly if the shoe company had something to do with him being left off the roster, he told reporters, ""I do, for sure,"" adding that there will be ""more stuff to come with that, but, as of now, I'm not going to comment on it."" What Hill said to Dan Patrick about ""conspiracy theories"" isn't much different than what he told reporters in Vegas shortly after the news on July 10: ""You get 12 spots, and you have to build a team. And one of the hardest things is leaving people off the roster that I'm a fan of that I look forward to watching throughout the season, throughout the playoffs. Guys who've been Finals MVPs, guys who've been a part of the program, guys who've won gold medals, guys who I respect, admire and enjoy watching. But the responsibility that I have is to put together a team and a team that complements each other, a team that fits a team that will give us the best opportunity for success. ""And, so, whatever theories that might be out there, they're just that. But that's my responsibility. And it's tough. It's tough to have conversations, tell people that they're not on the team."" In the interview with Patrick, though, he went deeper on the basketball reasons that led USA Basketball to White. Part of it, Hill said, was that, if coach Steve Kerr was going to play Bam Adebayo next to Anthony Davis in the frontcourt, then it made more sense to add a guard to the roster. Here's Hill's full answer about the process of selecting White:  ""I'm glad you brought that up. So, you know, we went to training camp, and we didn't have KD, KD was out -- Kevin Durant, sort of coming back from a calf injury. And then Jayson Tatum was late for arrival, he didn't show up the first two or three days. So we ended up having to sort of play Anthony Davis and Bam Adebayo together. And we didn't know if that would work. I think going into camp we thought let's have three centers -- much like in '96 when we had Hakeem Olajuwon, David Robinson and Shaquille O'Neal -- and we'll rotate. All three of them are different and provide different things, and so we'll have sort of a three-headed monster at the center position. But what we found, because we didn't have the numbers those first few days, was that Bam Adebayo and Atnhony Davis can really play well together at both ends of the floor and at times might be our best defensive lineup. So we kind of stumbled upon something. We learned something about our group during those four days in Vegas.  And so when we pivoted off of Kawhi Leonard, we said, 'OK, we got a little bit of a logjam now at the 4 position: LeBron James, Kevin Durant, Jayson Tatum, now Bam Adebayo -- all these guys can play the 4 and we envision them playing the 4. And so, OK, let's not bring another guy who might play that 3/4 position in; let's bring in someone now who can really give us great defense at the point of attack.' That was also a priority for putting this team together: being able to pick up full-court, guard and pressure the point guards of opposing teams. And Jrue Holiday might be the best in the world at doing this. But having some injuries that we had during camp, what happens if Jrue gets hurt? And so Derrick White might be the second best in the world at point-of-attack defense. So that was sort of the thought process. But we really learned about our team those days in Vegas and discovered something with Bam Adebayo and Anthony Davis on the court together that we really weren't thinking about prior to our arrival in Vegas."" ""I thought this was great for our team. To be able to feel the pressure was important.""-Grant Hill on what he was think when the US was down 16 to South Sudan#ParisOlympics pic.twitter.com/37E2LiEhIQ Even before that, White was on USA Basketball's radar.

Grant Hill,Jaylen Brown calls out USA Basketball director Grant Hill for ‘conspiracy’ remark,https://www.bostonglobe.com/2024/07/28/sports/jaylen-brown-grant-hill/,"Jaylen Brown and Derrick White might be on good terms after USA Basketball picked the latter as a last-minute replacement for the Olympics roster. It appears the same can’t be said though for Brown and the man who made that roster decision. Just hours ahead of the United States men’s national basketball team’s first game in the Olympics, Brown called out USA Basketball director Grant Hill on social media. “Grant Hill calling me a conspiracy theorist is disappointing. I’ve been a VP since I was 21 years old. I have a great understanding,” Brown wrote in a post on X, formerly known as Twitter, Sunday morning. Brown, who has been a vice president for the NBA Players’ Association since 2019, was likely replying to a comment Hill recently made on “The Dan Patrick Show.” Advertisement grant hill calling me a conspiracy theorist is disappointing I’ve been a VP since I was 21 years old I have a great understanding “This idea that there’s a conspiracy theory, I always love a good conspiracy theory, but it was really truly a basketball decision,” Hill said of Brown’s exclusion from the roster in Friday’s interview. “These are tough decisions, but having gone through this with the FIBA competition, you want to find the right balance and the right pieces on the court that we needed. “Not to say he wouldn’t have been good — there’s a lot of guys, a whole list of guys who are very capable and qualified — but for where we were, it was the right decision. Derrick White, I think, will help us as we pursue gold.” When it was announced that White would replace Kawhi Leonard on the United States roster earlier in July, Brown made multiple social media posts questioning the decision. He also implied that Nike played a role in his exclusion from the roster in one post. “I do for sure,” Brown told reporters later in July when asked if he thought Nike influenced USA Basketball’s decision to leave him off the roster. “There’ll be more stuff to come with that but as of now I’m not going to comment on it.” Brown, who previously endorsed Adidas, has made critical remarks about Nike in the past. Hill said that Nike doesn’t influence any roster decisions when it was first announced that White would replace Leonard on the roster. Hill further explained the decision to pick White over Brown and others during his appearance on “The Dan Patrick Show.” He said it was a matter of positional need, adding that the team felt good about its forward situation after Bam Adebayo played power forward during practice. Advertisement “Let’s bring in someone who can really give us great defense at the point of attack,” Hill said of the decision to add White. “That was also a priority for putting this team together: Being able to pick up full court, guard, and pressure the point guard of opposing teams. Jrue Holiday might be the best in the world at doing this. “But having some injuries we had during camp, what happens if Jrue gets hurt? Derrick White might be the second-best in the world at point-of-attack defense. That was sort of the thought process.” Hill also told Patrick that he called Brown’s agent to inform him that the Celtics star wouldn’t be on Team USA for the Olympics when White was added. It was reported in June that White was the top replacement for Leonard if the Clippers forward was unable to participate in the Olympics due to a knee injury. While Brown has expressed his frustration with USA Basketball and Nike in recent weeks, he holds no hard feelings with White. “I called Derrick right away,” Brown told reporters earlier in July. “Just to make sure there’s no confusion, my love for you and all of that. He knew that, and he did. You don’t always gotta make everything public. Me and D-White are good.” White confirmed that was the case in an interview with the Globe’s Adam Himmelsbach on Saturday. Advertisement “Jaylen gave me a call and I was like, ‘Yeah, you didn’t need to call me. I know we’re good,’” White said. “He gave me a call and said he just wanted to clear things up and I told him we’re all good. Never any problem or issue with us, for sure. He’s a hell of a player and I’ve never had a bad thing to say about JB.” Digital Access Home Delivery Gift Subscriptions Log In Manage My Account Customer Service Delivery Issues Feedback Help & FAQs Staff List Advertise Newsletters View the ePaper Order Back Issues News in Education Search the Archives Privacy Policy Terms of Service Terms of Purchase Contact Work at Boston Globe Media Internship Program Co-op Program Do Not Sell My Personal Information"
Golden Tate,"Tate & Lyle's dead lion to Salvador Dali designing Chupa Chups branding, the stories behind world's most famous logos",https://www.thesun.ie/news/12275028/stories-worlds-most-famous-logos/,"TATE & LYLE this week axed its 140-year-old golden syrup logo after shoppers branded it “grim”. The image, created in 1881, showed a dead lion being swarmed by bees and was inspired by a Biblical story of Samson killing one of the beasts. The new version features a lion’s head and a single bee. Mike Ridley looks at the stories of some of the world’s other best-known logos . . FAMOUS for its triangular shape, the Swiss chocolate features a logo with a mountain theme and the Matterhorn peak in the Swiss Alps. But if you look carefully, you’ll also see the design contains the shape of a bear, a symbol of the city of Bern, where it was first produced. NOW just a single letter “F”, the social media giant’s logo is kept simple on a blue background. This is probably explained by founder Mark Zuckerberg being red-green colourblind and finding blue the easiest colour to see. THE burger chain’s first restaurant was opened by Richard and Maurice McDonald in 1937. In 1952, when the company’s first-ever franchise restaurant opened, the design included two massive golden arches outside to attract customers. Nine years later, these yellow arches were adopted as the burger joint’s logo. THE original emblem for the coffee chain, which was founded in 1971, was a topless, two-tailed fantasy creature called a melusine. But in 1987 the designer changed the colour to green and the image to a more modest goddess. IT is a myth that Apple boss Steve Jobs chose an apple with a bite in homage to computer inventor Alan Turing who killed himself with a cyanide-laced apple. Jobs was on a fruit-only diet when he came up with it.  The reason for the bite was so people would not confuse it with a cherry.  It is also a play on the word “byte”. IT is alleged that in 1911, when Lord Montague put a statue of a woman on his Rolls-Royce Silver Ghost as a scandalous memento of an affair with his secretary, other owners copied him. Following the trend, legend has it that the luxury car firm commissioned a statue of a woman with her arms outstretched and clothes flowing to be put on every Roller. The Spirit of Ecstasy mascot — still used today — was born. THE legendary rockers were among the first bands in the world to have a logo. Nicknamed “Hot Lips”, the symbol was commissioned in 1970, when the Stones started their own firm to release their music. New design graduate John Pasche was paid just £50 for his work but the logo launched his career. WHILE some logos are dreamt up by unknown students or the company’s owner, this one for the Spanish lollipop brand has a famous designer. The colourful daisy- style logo, still used on the sweets to this day, was designed in 1969 by surrealist artist Salvador Dali better known for his “melting clocks”. UP there with McDonald’s as the world’s largest restaurant chain, Subway was founded in 1965 by 17-year old Fred DeLuca to serve healthy food to athletes. To save money he drew the logo himself.  The arrows on either end of the word are to symbolise food on the go. The logo is now on 44,000 outlets in 112 countries. THE Bass brewery was founded in 1777 in Burton-upon-Trent, Staffs. And the red triangle it used on its ales became, in 1876, the first registered trademark ever issued by the British Government. THE prancing black horse of Enzo Ferrari’s company was first used on its cars in 1947. It is actually a tribute to World War One pilot Francesco Baracca, who had a similar horse painted on his plane. Enzo visited Francesco’s father, who suggested he include it on his car. IT is perhaps the most famous logo in the world, but the white words on red background was not created by a designer. It was the company’s bookkeeper, Frank Robinson, who coined the name Coca-Cola and suggested two capital Cs would look good in adverts. The font he chose was a popular style of the 1880s, when the drink was invented. STUDENT Carolyn Davidson earned less than £30 in 1971 for designing the famous swoosh, which Nike boss Paul Knight did not like at first. Twelve years later, after Nike’s logo became one of the world’s best-known, Carolyn was given shares in the firm which would now be worth more than £1million. THE croc logo comes from the nickname of company founder and French tennis great Rene Lacoste.  He got the name after his team captain said he would buy him a crocodile-skin suitcase if he won his next match.  He lost. ©News Group Newspapers Limited in England No. 679215 Registered office: 1 London Bridge Street, London, SE1 9GF.

Jared Dudley,"Jared Dudley joins Mavericks' coaching staff after 14-year NBA career, calls it 'perfect fit and opportunity'",https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/jared-dudley-joins-mavericks-coaching-staff-after-14-year-nba-career-calls-it-perfect-fit-and-opportunity/,"If not listed, please contact your TV provider. Jared Dudley's playing days are over, but he isn't leaving the league. On Tuesday, Dudley announced that he would be retiring as a player in the NBA and accepting a role as an assistant coach with the Dallas Mavericks under new head coach Jason Kidd. Dudley will reportedly have a spot at the front of the bench alongside new head coach Jason Kidd.  The move was originally reported by longtime NBA insider Marc Stein and Shams Charania of Stadium and The Athletic. Dudley later confirmed it on his Twitter account:  I been preparing this moment for a long time! From deep talks With Nash, Hill, Shaq, Bron, Booker, Beal, AD, Giannis the list goes on.. Very excited to Join the MAVS and JKidd staff! Perfect fit and opportunity… Time to get to work ""I been preparing this moment for a long time! From deep talks With Nash, Hill, Shaq, Bron, Booker, Beal, AD, Giannis the list goes on,"" Dudley wrote. ""Very excited to Join the MAVS and JKidd staff! Perfect fit and opportunity… Time to get to work.""    In addition to announcing his move to the Mavs, Dudley also thanked the Lakers organization, owner Jeanie Buss, LeBron James and Anthony Davis for helping him win a championship late in his career.  Man what a ride! 14 yr NBA career capped off by winning a NBA championship with the @Lakers! Just want to thank GOD for blessing me, also want to personally thank @KingJames @AntDavis23 @JeanieBuss and the Lakers organization,Without Bron and AD I don’t join LAL or wing a 💍 Dudley played the last two seasons of his career with the Lakers. and after he announced his plans to join Dallas' coaching staff, the Lakers thanked him for the veteran leadership that he provided during his time with the team.  🙏🏽🙏🏽 https://t.co/FcGvZtBupy Lakers teammate LeBron James even reacted in shock when he learned that Dudley wouldn't be with the team anymore: ""Congrats to my guy if this true, which [it] probably is! But man!! F---,"" LeBron wrote. In a follow-up tweet James explained his uncensored initial reaction: ""Excuse my language but this one hurt!! For many reasons that you wouldn't understand.""   Kidd served as an assistant with the Lakers for the past two seasons, so the connection to Dudley makes sense. It's also a smart move by the Mavericks, as Dudley has been a vocal leader in L.A.'s locker room and in previous stints around the league. His presence on Dallas' coaching staff can provide this young team with a veteran voice who just finished playing in the league, and serve as a bridge between the players and the coaches. Adding Dudley is just the latest move in what has been an overhaul of the Mavericks coaching staff and front office this summer. Longtime general manager Donnie Nelson and head coach Rick Carlisle stepped down following another first-round exit in the playoffs and an explosive article detailing the dysfunction that existed within the franchise. That led Dallas to bring in former Nike executive Nico Harrison as the new head of basketball operations, and hire Kidd as the head coach.  Dallas is hoping that these moves will help move the needle in the direction of more success in the postseason and in free agency -- two areas where this franchise has failed for the better part of the last decade. © 2004-2024 CBS Interactive.

Anthony Edwards,Noah Lyles breaks silence on Anthony Edwards drama and Adidas shoe event snub,https://talksport.com/sport/basketball/2005961/noah-lyles-nba-anthony-edwards-olympics-adidas/,"Noah Lyles' confidence has landed him in hot water over the years but he always backs it up. The outspoken American sprinter silenced the doubters at the 2024 Olympics in Paris, capturing a gold medal in the 100m and winning an improbable bronze in the 200m while dealing with COVID-19. Lyles is no stranger to controversy in the NBA world (more on that in a second), and on Monday rubbed basketball folk up the wrong way again over some resurfaced comments of his. During an feature with Sean Gregory of TIME last year, Lyles appeared to take a shot at Minnesota Timberwolves and Team USA Basketball star Anthony Edwards - who recently helped the US to Olympic gold. Lyles had made it clear that he wanted a signature sneaker with his apparel sponsor, Adidas, and was offended when, in the middle of contract extension talks with the clothing and footwear giant, the brand invited him to an event promoting Anthony Edwards’ new shoe. ""You want to do what?"" Lyles said.  ""You want to invite me to [an event for] a man who has not even been to an NBA Finals? In a sport that you don't even care about? And you're giving him a shoe?  ""No disrespect; the man is an amazing athlete. He is having a heck of a year. I love that they saw the insight to give him a shoe, because they saw that he was going to be big. All I'm asking is, 'How could you not see that for me?'"" The resurfaced quotes caused quite the stir online, with many people defending ""Ant-Man"" over the unnecessary disrespect. It wasn't long before Lyles caught wind of his resurfaced quotes, and he took to social media to quieten the noise. ""This is a rumor going around that I did not go to [Anthony Edwards]'s shoe release because he didn't deserve it,"" Lyles said on X.  ""That is not the case. He definitely deserves his shoes. He is an amazing player. The problem was finding time based on my prior engagement. Congrats on becoming an Olympic champion!"" This isn't the first time the Olympic gold medalist has drawn the ire of basketball fans and pros. Last year he sparked a huge debate after claiming NBA champions shouldn't be called 'world champions' because it's a league entirely made up of teams from the United States, and Canada (Toronto Raptors). Winners of virtually every major American sport are known as 'world champions' due to them being the biggest leagues in the world - in that particular sport - with the best players. However critics, including Lyles, said teams shouldn't call themselves 'world champions' unless they've played -- and beaten -- other nation's teams. “You know the thing that hurts me the most is that I have to watch the NBA Finals and they have ‘world champion’ on their head,” Lyles said. “World champion of what? The United States? Don’t get me wrong, I love the U.S., at times, but that ain’t the world.” Two-time NBA champion and 2014 MVP Kevin Durant wrote on Instagram at the time, ""Somebody help this brother."" Warriors star Draymond Green posted, “When being smart goes wrong” with the facepalm emoji while Suns shooter Devin Booker, posted facepalm emoji. However, after LeBron James and Steph Curry led USA men's basketball to gold in Paris, and Diana Taurasi and A'ja Wilson did the same for the women, Lyles has somewhat softened his original stance. ""It's not a thing of if I consider or not,"" Lyles said. ""It's...they are. They're Olympic champions and in the Olympic champions you face the whole world.'"" ""And they saw how difficult it is,"" Lyles added. ""'And of course they came out on top and of course I knew they would. Because we have some of the greatest athletes but they saw you can't just slap everybody together and say 'This is a great team.' ""You know there was a ton of countries out there who said 'Hey we're not lying down just because we don't play in the NBA. You know we have cohesion. We have our own way of playing the game,'"" Lyles continued.  ""And there was a lot of close calls. But again, like myself, I have confidence in the U.S. basketball team that they were going to make it all the way."" Lyles' original comments seem to be water under the bridge now. Booker was one of the people who congratulated him after he won the 100m gold in the Stade de France. “It was crazy,” the Team USA star told The Athletic. “I mean, it was great for America. Congrats to him. However, he added: ""I still don't agree with the comment. ""I feel like all the best talent in the world is in the NBA, and this is coming from an Olympic gold medalist [who believes] that being an NBA champion is probably harder to do.""

Anthony Edwards,Noah Lyles clarified Anthony Edwards comment in latest controversy with NBA player,https://www.sbnation.com/nba/2024/8/12/24218563/noah-lyles-nba-anthony-edwards-comments-adidas-shoes-event,"Filed under: The track superstar is in the middle of beef again after comments about Timberwolves star Anthony Edwards came to light. United States track star Noah Lyles earned an avalanche of media attention for refusing to call NBA champions “world champions” during comments made in 2023. As his “world Champion of what” remark gained new life during the 2024 Paris Olympics, another comment Lyles made about an NBA star has received new life — and it caused Lyles to clarify his remarks on Monday.  After the U.S. men’s basketball team won gold in Paris, an interview he did with TIME magazine re-surfaced where he takes a swipe at Minnesota Timberwolves superstar guard Anthony Edwards. Lyles essentially questioned why Adidas would unveil a new shoe for Edwards and not give him the same respect.  When Lyles was negotiating an Adidas contract extension last year, the company, he says, threw him what it thought was a bone. Adidas invited him to the shoe-release event for Anthony Edwards, the rising Minnesota Timberwolves star who’s got plenty of talent but, unlike Lyles, isn’t a six-time world champ. “You want to do what?” says Lyles. “You want to invite me to [an event for] a man who has not even been to an NBA Finals? In a sport that you don’t even care about? And you’re giving him a shoe? No disrespect: the man is an amazing athlete. He is having a heck of a year. I love that they saw the insight to give him a shoe, because they saw that he was going to be big. All I’m asking is, ‘How could you not see that for me?’” (Adidas declined to comment; in February, Lyles signed a new deal with the company, reportedly the most lucrative track-and-field contract in the post-Bolt era.) Lyles took to social media to refute the report, saying that he didn’t go to Edwards’ shoe event because he had a prior engagement. There is a rumor going around that I did not go to @theantedwards_ shoe release because he didn’t deserve it. That is not the case he definitely deserves his shoes he is an amazing player. The problem was finding time based on my prior engagements. Congratulations on Becoming an… Lyles was under immense pressure after the “world champion of what” comments, and for the most part he backed it up. He won gold in the 100m dash, making him the fastest man on Earth, but only got bronze in the 200m dash (Lyles tested positive for COVID-19 before the race). However, it can be said that those same comments helped put the US Men’s basketball team together in the first place. This beef between Lyles and the NBA won’t be going away anytime soon.

Lyles, who won the gold medal in the men’s 100m discipline was accused of not attending Anthony Edwards’ special shoe launch event with Adidas recently. The general consensus going around was that Lyles did not find all the hype worth it and was of the opinion that Anthony Edwards did not deserve so much attention at such a young age.  However, debunking the rumors and speculations, Noah Lyles took to his X account recently and clarified the reason for not attending Edwards’ event.

As a matter of fact, 23-year-old Anthony Edwards has been on the rise in the NBA horizon in recent times. Although the youngster failed to bring glory for his country in the World Cup, Edwards surely did not disappoint in Paris.

Anthony Edwards of United States scores a basket Pool via REUTERS/Mark J Terrill Looking at Edwards’ meteoric rise, Adidas decided to honor him by offering a multi-million dollar contract. This deal will supposedly dish out an 8-figure pay per year. After the Olympics too, Adidas continued their worshipping of Edwards. Dropping a brand new ad campaign, Adidas gave the caption, ‘From Atlanta to the World. Anthony Edwards is just getting started. Believe That.’ They also rolled out an exclusive golden Adidas AE 1s to acknowledge Anthony Edwards’ Olympic feat.  That brings us to Noah Lyles. The phenom of the American track and field realm is also an Adidas-registered athlete. Lyles and Adidas signed a multi year contract extension in February, with the details of the deal remaining undisclosed. After winning the gold medal, Lyles seemed to be dissatisfied with all the hype that Adidas had been creating around Anthony Edwards. Expressing his frustration, Lyles said, “You want to invite me to [an event for] a man who has not even been to an NBA Finals? In a sport that you don’t even care about? And you’re giving him a shoe?” ADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad Lyles then went on to express his desire to own an exclusive range of sneakers, instead of spikes. He said, “I want my own shoe… Ain’t no money in spikes.” Such a comment coming from the Olympic gold medalist riled up the entire internet and Lyles was subjected to very harsh criticism. Well, this was not the only controversy that Noah Lyles has been involved in Paris.  Noah Lyles won the men’s 100m by a matter of five-thousandths of a second. After finishing identically at 9.79s with Jamaican rival Kishane Thompson, Lyles was elated as the scoreboard announced the gold medal in favor of Noah Lyles. However, despite his clean victory, the Jamaican fans did not seem to be happy with the results. They insisted that Kishane Thompson had been ‘robbed’ of a deserving gold medal.  ADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad Reacting to the news, Noah Lyles mentioned that the Jamaicans were jealous because they did not expect Lyles to come out all guns blazing, especially when he was being thrashed for his slow timings all year round. Lyles stated, “Unfortunately, they went from not having a dog in the fight last year to having a great dog in the fight this year. So they went from loving me to hating me very quickly.” The gold also meant that Lyles had won his duel with Ferdinand Omanyala, who gave an Usain Bolt-like lookover to Lyles after beating the American at the Racers Grand Prix.  Speaking about controversies and backlashes from the Jamaicans, Noah Lyles’ personal space was also not spared. Lyles announced his romantic involvement with Jamaican female athlete, Junelle Bromfield. Ever since then, both Lyles and Bromfield have been constantly attacked by the Jamaicans. Calling Bromfield a ‘traitor’ every time she cheered for Lyles, the fans also launched scathing attacks on Bromfield after she faltered in her 400m outing in Paris. Reacting to the hate, Lyles lashed out in a Track World Sports exclusive, “I have been getting the drama from Jamaican camps for at least five years now.” Thus, with the above accounts, it is evident that Noah Lyles might have won the Olympic gold, but he will have his work cut out to tackle the negativities and controversies surrounding him in the days to come.

Anthony Edwards,"""Usain Bolt HAD a Shoe"": NFL Legend Slaps Noah Lyles With Ultimate Reality on Anthony Edwards & Adidas Controversy",https://www.essentiallysports.com/nba-active-basketball-news-usain-bolt-had-a-shoe-nfl-legend-slaps-noah-lyles-with-ultimate-reality-on-anthony-edwards-and-adidas-controversy/,"More Sports ES Fancast Aug 12, 2024 | 8:56 AM EDT via Imago Credits: IMAGO via Imago Credits: IMAGO Usain Bolt's take on Anthony Edwards—Is he right about the Adidas controversy? Noah Lyles has rubbed people the wrong way again. Last year, he miffed the NBA players and legends when he started the world championship debate. Now, after Team USA has brought home the gold, an old story has resurfaced about Lyles’ being unhappy over the NBA stars’ entitlement in signature shoe deals. As per the latest developments, tensions heightened between Adidas and Lyles when they invited the Paris Olympics 100m gold medalist for Anthony Edwards’ shoe launch last year. In a recent interaction with Time before the Olympics, Lyles revealed that he couldn’t swallow the bitter pill because Edwards did not even have the ‘NBA Finals’ stamp. “You want to do what? You want to invite me to [an event for] a man who has not even been to an NBA Finals? In a sport that you don’t even care about? And you’re giving him a shoe? No disrespect — the man is an amazing athlete. He is having a heck of a year. I love that they saw the insight to give him a shoe because they saw that he was going to be big,” Lyles said. Ultimately, Lyles wanted to prove his candidacy for a signature shoe as a 3x World Champion. However, it irked the athletic community, as usual. This time, NFL legends Shannon Sharpe and Chad Johnson dropped their views on the Nightcap. After going through the whole of the Adidas- Noah Lyles controversy narrative, ex-NFL star Ocho[Chad] stated, “I think that hard part is that as a track runner the market and demand for a track runner shoe, it wouldn’t be as significant as a NBA basketball player who was seen globally.” ADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad via Reuters Paris 2024 Olympics – Basketball – Men’s Group Phase – Group C – Puerto Rico vs United States – Lille, Pierre Mauroy Stadium, Villeneve-d’Ascq, France – August 03, 2024.

Michael Johnson had a shoe, and Usain Bolt had a shoe. They still don’t make those shoes. Why is that?  Kobe’s been deceased for four years, but they still make Kobes, they still make Jordans, they’re still gonna LeBron when LeBron retires, and they still gonna make KD when KD retires. There’s a reason why Noah!” Noah Lyles’ objection to attending Anthony Edwards’ shoe launch might affect his future relationship with Adidas. ADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad Earlier this year, Lyles signed a lucrative extension with Adidas. Reportedly, it was the most expensive deal for a track and field athlete after the legendary Usain Bolt’s deal with Puma. However, just after signing the deal, releasing a statement against a fellow athlete who endorses the same brand might land Lyles in trouble. Ocho confessed the same, as he stated, “There are certain battles that you shouldn’t fight. … You pick your battles wisely as someone who is great at their sports. Stuff like this can turn brands away, can turn market opportunities away even though you’re a gold winner.” Ocho’s partner Sharpe explained that despite his demand for a signature shoe deal, Lyles can’t promote the brand the same way as the NBA stars. The NBA stars can get their fellow teammates to wear their “shoes.” It happens quite often as the NBA players have been seen donning LeBrons and Kobes. However, Noah hasn’t got that privilege since every track and field athlete wants to don his own name on the heel, not others’. Noah Lyles should probably carry it easy, as Anthony Edwards is already a loved name in the sports community. Despite his excellence, Lyles’ words might not seem amicable to all and it might not serve him well in the marketplace. But who knows what fate awaits? Maybe Lyles can get a signature shoe deal as the first track and field athlete, just like Anthony Edwards! What do you all think?

The German shoemakers had reportedly requested the United States sprinter to attend an Anthony Edwards event in 2023. The story did not end well as Lyles was left slightly triggered by the invitation to the upcoming NBA star’s show. The incident came to light recently after TIME Magazine’s Sean Gregory posted an article about Lyles’ preparation for the Paris Olympics. The article mentioned how the American sprinter had reacted after being requested to attend the event of the Minnesota Timberwolves star. “You want to do what,” Lyles said. This incident occurred when Noah Lyles was negotiating a contract extension with Adidas. During the process, the German brand thought inviting Lyles to an Anthony Edwards event would be a good idea. But the sprinter was offended at the offer as he did not see the Minnesota Timberwolves star on the same level as him.

Noah Lyles had a photo-finish win in the 100-meter race during the 2024 Paris Olympics. However, he is now making headlines for his comments about NBA players. One of his comments about Anthony Edwards has resurfaced online, which he made in June while speaking to Sean Gregory of Time. And guess what? The new WBC heavyweight champion Claressa Shields thinks it’s because of jealousy.  Lyles took offense to Adidas, the widely popular sports apparel brand, inviting him to a shoe release event for Minnesota Timberwolves star Anthony Edwards. This miffed the 27-year-old sprinter, who said, “You want to do what?’ You want to invite me to [an event for] a man who has not even been to an NBA Finals? In a sport that you don’t even care about? And you’re giving him a shoe?”  Noah Lyles expressed respect for Edwards, acknowledging his impressive performance and standout year in the NBA. Lyles also appreciated the foresight Adidas showed in endorsing him as a rising star in the NBA by giving him a shoe deal. However, Lyles questioned, “How could you not see that for me?” ADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad This looks Luke jealousy to me https://t.co/D7gaWgxKhj — Claressa Gwoat Shields (@Claressashields) August 11, 2024 Expand Tweet Did Noah Lyles just throw shade at Anthony Edwards?

And it’s not just her. New York Knicks point guard Jalen Brunson also reacted to the same statements, writing, “Damn I thought this was Centel.” However, this wasn’t the first time Lyles has made headlines for his statement about the NBA, nor is it the first time Shields has reacted to it.  ADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad Not too long ago, Claressa Shields took to X, commenting on the resurfaced interview of Noah Lyles from August 2023, where he criticized the NBA’s use of the term “world champion”. Lyles, a five-time world champion, fresh off his 100-meter win at the World Championships in Budapest, had expressed his frustration that NBA players were called world champions despite the league’s primarily American focus.  This interview forever funny https://t.co/dAQZ42fj8u — Claressa Gwoat Shields (@Claressashields) August 6, 2024 Expand Tweet  ADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad He argued that the true global competition was the World Championships, where athletes from around the world competed. Shields responded to the clip with a playful jab, tweeting, “This interview [is] forever funny.” Originally, when the interview had gone viral, Kevin Durant reacted to the comments from Lyles, stating, “Somebody help this brother.” However, after Team USA basketball defeated France in the gold-medal game recently, even the official USA Basketball X account took shots at Lyles, writing, “Are we the World Champs now?” It appears Noah Lyles’ recent gold win in the 2024 Paris Olympics has started a lot of trouble for the 27-year-old because of his past comments on basketball and its players.

Gold at the Paris Olympics proved there is no end to Noah Lyles’ success, but no end to his feud with the NBA either it seems. The 27-year-old already landed in controversy with his remarks on NBA champs, but this time it’s about a particular NBA star! The comment stemming from his desire to get a sneaker deal with Nike seems to be an attack of sorts on Minnesota Timberwolves’ Anthony Edwards. While the Ant Man has not responded yet, former NBA star Stephen Jackson seems to be done with the insult for his league. The official Instagram account for Bleacher Report recently posted Lyles’ comments about Edwards. “His mouth ruining his career by the minute,” Jackson commented on the post. Notably, the comments were recently revealed by TIME’s Sean Gregory mentioning there existed a tension between Adidas and Lyles that stemmed from the brand inviting the track athlete to the Wolves’ star’s shoe release event. “You want to invite me to [an event for] a man who has not even been to an NBA Finals? In a sport that you don’t even care about? And you’re giving him a shoe?” Lyles said, as per the report. He further mentioned he means no disrespect to Anthony Edwards, as he is an amazing athlete.

However, after claiming gold at the Paris Olympics, Lyles has yet again demanded his own sneaker deal. “… I’m dead serious. I want a sneaker, ain’t no money in [track] spikes. There’s money in sneakers…” he said. It’s worth mentioning landing sneaker deals is not an easy task for track athletes. Usain Bolt has been among the rare ones to crack it with Puma. His frustration could’ve been understandable had it not come at the expense of another athlete. And it’s not as if this is the first instance that Lyes has thrown shade at NBA stars. ADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad This came during a press conference when Lyles secured gold at the World Athletics Championship. During the conference, the 27-year-old criticized the NBA for calling the winners of league’s finals as world champions. He pointed out he has seen winners wearing this tag on their heads during the Finals. “World champion of what? The United States?” he added. He further mentioned although he loves the US, but the world is not limited to that. Lykes argued one has to contest where multiple countries are participating, in order to be termed as world champion. The comments received backlash from numerous NBA fans and athletes. Kevin Durant was no exception to this as he wrote, “Somebody help this brother” on an IG post. Even Team USA management did not hold back from taking a light-hearted dig at the 27-year-old track athlete. Securing the gold after a 98-87 win over France, the official X account of USA Basketball asked if they are eligible for the tag now. “Are we the World Champs now?” read the post.

It goes back to his playing career, recalling how he would square off against manager Terry Francona during Napoli’s one season in Cleveland.Those settings allow for personal connections and bonding where the focus isn’t about baseball.“Being able to go back and forth between player-coach-type personality stuff, it’s just so valuable,” manager David Ross said of Napoli to the Tribune. “It really is.”Napoli, 40, always figured he would get into coaching once his playing career ended. But he thought he’d take more time off after he retired in 2018 because of a torn ACL suffered in Triple A. He quickly realized, however, he didn’t know how to fill so much free time.So when Ross, his teammate for two years in Boston, reached out after taking over as Cubs manager in October 2019 to see if he was interested in joining his staff, Napoli knew he was ready to commit to coaching.Napoli, in his third season with the organization, has enjoyed a different side of the game while taking on a bigger role this year as first base coach.
Chicago Cubs first base coach Mike Napoli runs onto the field in the first inning against the White Sox at Wrigley Field, May 3, 2022.“I know the game of baseball, but actually being able to teach it and get into the players’ heads and try to help them out, I’ve been learning,” Napoli told the Tribune. “I’m trying to pick my spots to getting the message out. It’s a little different than when I played.

“It’s been a learning experience, but I think I’m growing every day to become better as a coach.”One aspect of coaching that has surprised Napoli is the amount of hours spent at the ballpark. As a player, Napoli didn’t realize how much time coaches put in daily: “Shoot, coaches are underpaid,” he added with a laugh.The long hours are a worthwhile investment for Napoli, both in his desire to help Cubs players improve and his long-term career goal to become a major-league manager.“I’ve always wanted to manage, but I knew I was going to have to take the steps to learn,” Napoli said. “I’m always up for that. I always want to make myself the best I possibly can. I don’t know everything about this game. I’m going to learn new stuff every day.”Napoli’s big-league résumé made him an attractive addition to the coaching staff, and he had garnered attention from other teams before committing to the Cubs. Over a 12-year career with four organizations, Napoli made an All-Star team, appeared in three World Series — winning a title with Ross on the 2013 Red Sox — while producing a career .246/.346/.475 line with 267 home runs and 117 OPS+ as a catcher-turned-first baseman/designated hitter.“He’s got a really good reputation in the game,” Ross said. “He’s done a lot and he’s somebody that, one, we have history together, we’re friends, but he’s also somebody that carries a lot of weight when it comes to experience in this game. That goes a long way in the dugout with the players.”Napoli is one of six among the Cubs’ field staff with major-league playing experience, joining Ross, bench coach Andy Green, pitching coach Tommy Hottovy, third base coach Willie Harris and assistant pitching coach Daniel Moskos.
Chicago Cubs first base coach Mike Napoli warms his helmet during the fifth inning against the Tampa Bay Rays at Wrigley Field, April 18, 2022.“They know how hard the game is, they know the league,” president of baseball operations Jed Hoyer told the Tribune. “They relate a little bit better to them and I think it’s important to have a mix of those guys on the staff. You don’t want a full staff of guys like that. You also don’t want to have an entire staff made up of guys that won’t necessarily understand what these (players) are going through.“Rossy and the people that were around (Napoli), everyone spoke so highly of not only was he a great teammate, but a great base runner, really paid attention and focused on things and he’s got a real presence about him.”After spending his first two seasons as a quality assurance coach, the Cubs moved Napoli to first base coach and shifted Craig Driver, who had filled that role since 2020, into the dugout as their game strategy and catching coach prior to the 2022 season.The Cubs felt the change upgraded both areas and played to each coach’s strengths. Base running instruction is among Napoli’s duties.“It’s given him accountability, fire, does his homework on the pitcher, does the small little things you have to do on the opposing team that has made him even more invested in the guys,” Ross said. “Because he wants all of them to have success and tries to create friendships with all those guys.”Napoli is enjoying his new role. He admitted he was getting worn out by his previous position and didn’t have much to do in the dugout during games.“I felt like I was turning into a psychologist,” Napoli said. “I was trying to talk people down, like, ‘Bro, everything’s OK.’ It just turned into that kind of thing. But being out there now, every time having something to do, to worry about and have my own area, it’s been awesome.”Veteran catcher Yan Gomes and Napoli were Cleveland teammates in 2016 when they ultimately lost to the Cubs in the World Series. Gomes describes Napoli as a quiet, intense guy who loves baseball. He isn’t surprised by Napoli’s transition to the coaching side. Even then, six years ago, Gomes envisioned Napoli going this route.

He just has to figure it out a little bit of being a mentor and a coach, but for me, he doesn’t have to change who he was with me in 2016.”Napoli generally considers himself a chill, laid-back guy. Maybe that sounds surprising given the “Party at Napoli’s” moniker that gained attention during Cleveland’s run to the World Series. A fan created a sign with the phrase in April 2016, inspired by Napoli’s celebration style after winning the title in 2013. The sign caught Napoli’s and the team’s attention, which turned into an official t-shirt with proceeds reaching more than $200,000 donated to the Cleveland Clinic Children’s Hospital.Whether it’s bonding over card games or putting in long days at the ballpark, Napoli is embracing his role with the Cubs.“I did like to have fun off the field, I mean, I think everyone knows that,” Napoli said. “But I think that’s where you get to know your teammates, and I always like bringing people together. Sometimes we get a little cliquey in the clubhouse. If it was off the field, you want to have a party or do whatever, it was that. But people become closer when you get away from the field.“In this game people are tough on themselves, so that demeanor hopefully helps people relax a little bit.” Veteran left-hander Wade Miley has been one of his toughest opponents while infielders Nico Hoerner and Nick Madrigal have started learning to play.

Chandler Parsons,NBA Veteran Asks Caitlin Clark’s Haters to “Eat S**t” in Surprise Rant After Historic Nike Deal,https://www.essentiallysports.com/nba-legends-wnba-basketball-news-nba-veteran-asks-caitlin-clarks-haters-to-eat-sht-in-surprise-rant-after-historic-nike-deal/,"More Sports ES Fancast Apr 19, 2024 | 8:30 AM EDT USA Today via Reuters Apr 15, 2024; Brooklyn, NY, USA; Caitlin Clark before the 2024 WNBA Draft at

Brooklyn Academy of Music. Mandatory Credit: Brad Penner-USA TODAY Sports Caitlin Clark and her counterparts made women’s basketball a must-watch in the NCAA since last year. That value hasn’t waned for any of them going into the WNBA. But their salaries have. From millions in NILs as collegiate athletes, Clark and other female basketball players have taken a huge pay cut entering the WNBA. Clark’s $76,000 rookie salary is spurring the pay disparity discussion in comparison to NBA rookies. But Chandler Parsons subscribes to the old notion that someone’s salary is nobody’s business. The no.1 draft pick overall, NCAA’s all-time scoring champion, and the newest Indiana Fever star, is close to signing a historic 8-figure endorsement contract with Nike. Yet some trolls think a low-paid WNBA rookie doesn’t deserve a big sneaker deal. Parsons though is on the “side of people getting paid.” So while he was on Run it Back, he told all the Clark trolls, “All these people making fun of [Caitlin Clark’s] WNBA salary, eat s**t, ’cause she’s making more money than you, so keep hating, she’s changing the game, she’s awesome, she deserves it and she’s gonna kill it in the WNBA… I hope this is just the beginning of these girls getting these massive deals.” ADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad Yes, it’s disappointing that the stars of NCAA like Clark, Cameron Brink, Rickea Jackson, and reigning champ Kamilla Cardoso are tied at the highest rookie salary with roughly $76,535 for the WNBA while their male counterparts get paid more. Parsons started at $850,000 in 2011. Victor Wembanyama will earn over $12 million for this season. His Nike shoe deal is rumored to be worth $100 million. But Parsons’ deal with Anta was a tad lower, $1 million, compared to Clark’s. ADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad But he also has a point, since most players earn more than their pro-league salaries through endorsement deals. Considering her NIL worth was $3.1 million, her endorsement appeal is at its prime and worth as much. Moreover, Parson projected that it’s only upwards for Clark and other WNBA rookies from here. Parsons got practical a little bit there when he said, “Their salaries are crazy. So they’re going to find other ways for them to make money.” Since these ladies are already attracting major sponsorship deals, the retired pro is excited for what’s to come. ADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad “This is a huge start for women in general, and the WNBA” And for those who are jealous Clark’s out-earning them, he says, “She got a bag, so keep laughing at her salary, but she’s the peak.” And when the ink dries on that 8-figure Nike deal, Caitlin Clark will have the last laugh all the way to the bank.

Bam Adebayo,Can Team USA help Bam Adebayo become a stretch big man for the Miami Heat?,https://www.sbnation.com/nba/2024/7/24/24205128/bam-adebayo-miami-heat-team-usa-olympics-stretch-five,"Filed under: Adebayo is stretching out his game with Team USA, and it could be a big benefit for the Heat. Bam Adebayo is one of the best two-way players in basketball. In every season from 2019 to 2023, Adebayo finished in the 80th percentile or higher in both Offensive and Defensive Estimated Plus-Minus (per Dunks & Threes).  But given that the Miami Heat sat around idly as their Eastern Conference contemporaries grew stronger (namely the New York Knicks and the Philadelphia 76ers), they are going to need Adebayo to hit another level if they hope to keep pace.  Adebayo’s recent performance against Team Serbia during Olympic play has some people pinpointing a pathway for his ascension: developing into a bonafide stretch big.  Given how he ended last season and what he’s doing today, 2024-25 really could be the season Bam becomes a legit stretch big Adebayo isn’t the interior scorer that guys like Giannis Antetokounmpo or Anthony Davis are (he was only in the 32nd percentile in rim frequency among bigs last year, per Cleaning the Glass). So, adding a consistent three-point shot is a great way to increase his scoring volume without tanking his efficiency. Plus, it adds floor spacing to a Heat team that desperately needs it.  But how viable is it for Adebayo to become a true stretch big man? A stretch big man is a center who can hit enough threes at a high enough clip in order to compel defenses to pay attention to them when they are spaced on the perimeter. Shooting 45 percent from three means very little if you are only attempting one three per game. The same is true for someone taking nine threes a game and only hitting 25 percent of them (although I doubt any coach would allow a player to attempt that many threes if that were the case).  The case for Bam Adebayo becoming a stretch big man While I am by no means a shot doctor, most good shooters have two things going for them: good touch and a quick release.  Last season, Adebayo shot 35.7 percent on 42 three-point attempts. That isn’t nearly enough of a sample size to extract any insight from. But as a general rule, you can also get a sense of a player’s touch by looking at their midrange and free throw percentages. Adebayo has multiple seasons that demonstrate his proficiency in both those areas. Not only does Adebayo hit midrange jumpers and free throws at an above-average rate for his position, but he does it on elite-level volume.  Adebayo clearly has pristine touch. The problem is that his release speed isn’t nearly as enticing. The following montage of clips probably won’t say too much until we look at some other players, but notice how long it takes Adebayo to launch catch-and-shoot threes (the type of threes spacers take) and how much of a dip he has in his shot.  This exaggerated dip is a big reason why Adebayo was only able to launch 0.6 threes per 75 possessions (7th percentile).  To better understand Adebayo’s chances of developing into a stretch big man, we’re going to compare Adebayo’s indicators to other players who started out as non-threats from the outside but later developed into legitimate/passable stretch big men. Brook Lopez Arguably, the most famous example of a player who went from non-shooter to stretch big is Brook Lopez. Lopez took just 31 total threes during the first eight seasons of his career, only to launch 2,651 in the next eight.  Even before Lopez was hoisting triples at an extreme rate, he always exhibited great touch. In 2015-16, the last season before his transformation, Lopez was in the 90th percentile in midrange frequency and the 87th percentile in midrange efficiency.  As for release speed, Lopez’s current release (first clip in the montage below) is much quicker than Adebayo’s, as evidenced by his significant advantage in 3-point volume (63rd percentile in 3-point attempts per 75 last year). But the major worry for Adebayo here is that Lopez’s release was always pretty quick (second clip), even before he became a true stretch big.  As we will see in a second, it will become a recurring theme that it is very difficult to change release speed throughout one’s career (at least for centers).  Al Horford The only example of a self-made stretch big that is as famous as Lopez is Al Horford. In his first eight seasons, he took a few more threes than Lopez (65). Of course, Horford went on to beast that total by taking 2,210 threes in the last nine seasons.  Like Lopez and Adebayo, Horford flashed great touch from the midrange and free throw line before he started taking a bunch of threes. And also like Lopez (but unlike Adebayo), Horford had very little dip on catch-and-shoot jumpers, even prior to his earning the stretch big moniker. The clip below is from the 2014-15 season. (Sidebar #1: Despite his elderly status, Horford still maintains a pretty quick release.) Larry Nance Jr. Larry Nance Jr. doesn’t have the reputation as a spacer that Lopez and Horford do. Last season, he shot 41.5 percent from three – a major step up from the 10 percent he shot during his rookie season. But he did it on pedestrian volume (14th percentile in threes per 75). On top of that, Nance has not shown the same level of midrange/free throw shooting pedigree that the other three players we’ve discussed so far. Between him, Adebayo, Lopez, and Horford, Nance is the only one who has a career free throw percentage under 70 percent (69.6 percent). On a spectrum of stretch bigs, he falls much closer to the “passable” end than the “legitimate” one.  With all that said, Nance, like Lopez and Horford, has always touted a speedy release. Although, he does have more of a dip than Lopez and Horford.  Wendell Carter Jr. Wendell Carter Jr. didn’t surpass the 30 percent mark from downtown until his fourth season in the NBA. But that didn’t stop him from becoming a 37.4 percent three-point shooter on solid volume (40th percentile in threes per 75) last year. His touch is nothing to write home about, either. Carter has finished below the league average on midrange jumpers in three of his six NBA seasons (including the 2022-23 season).  As for his release speed, it is the most comparable to Adebayo’s – slow with a pronounced dip. Here is an example from the present day (first clip in the montage below) and one from before his emergence as a shooter (second clip): (Sidebar #2: I also studied the jumpers of Myles Turner and Jaylin Williams, and both of them have always had quicker releases with very little dip.) The Bottom Line So, what do all these numbers and historical analysis mean for Adebayo’s chances? Here, we focused on two players (Lopez and Horford) who went from being zero spacers to elite ones for their position and two players (Nance and Carter) who went from self-check to solid stretch centers.  Even before their evolution, Lopez and Horford always had great touch, a quick release, and very little dip on their jumper. Adebayo may have that first feature, but his shooting mechanics are lacking in the other two areas, making it hard for me to envision him ever becoming an elite stretch big. Nance doesn’t have Adebayo’s touch, and he also lets the ball dip quite a bit when he shoots it from three. However, his release is/was noticeably faster than Adebayo’s, and even then, he isn’t that effective of a stretch center. Adebayo’s best role model for this journey is Carter. Adebayo has more proven touch, but both of them share similar mechanical shortcomings. At the end of the day, if Adebayo is going to be a stretch big, it is likely going to be similar to the type of spacer Carter is. That isn’t needle-moving floor spacing (see how unimpressive the Orlando Magic’s offensive rating is when Carter is on the floor). So, pairing him next to another poor spacer still wouldn’t be ideal. But if you can manage to surround him with four good spacers, that could lead to a pretty wide-open basketball court.  (Sidebar #3: If you are wondering why I focused solely on players currently in the league for this study, it’s because, before the pace-and-space era, it was very uncommon for a center who wasn’t a good shooter coming into the league to become a volume 3-point shooter.)

Tyler Lockett,How ‘Tyler Toe Tap’ Lockett showcases the NFL’s fanciest footwork,https://theathletic.com/5058871/2023/11/14/tyler-lockett-toe-tap-seahawks/,"NFL The Athletic has live coverage of the Dallas Cowboys vs. Seattle Seahawks on Thursday Night Football Tyler Lockett is the official real estate partner of the Seattle Seahawks, a business venture he keeps separate from his role as the team’s offensive captain and star receiver. But his highlight-reel catches have his teammates and coaches campaigning for Lockett to claim ownership of a specific piece of land at Lumen Field. Advertisement “One day, in the way distant future when Tyler hangs them up, I hope they have a bunch of footprints in that left corner of Lumen Field to represent all the amazing plays he’s made in that same spot over and over again,” offensive coordinator Shane Waldron said. In Sunday’s win over the Washington Commanders, Lockett demonstrated that his stellar spatial awareness isn’t limited to the south end zone. The entire field is Lockett’s playground when it’s time to flash his fancy footwork. Lockett is second in Seahawks history with 58 receiving touchdowns, and his latest at Lumen Field — a diving snag while dragging both feet in near the right sideline in the north end zone — was another illustration of how he has mastered the art of the toe drag. That 5-yard score gave Seattle a 26-19 lead late in the fourth — and another reason for his teammates to marvel at his work. FOR THE LEAD! pic.twitter.com/EJAhvBeoWz — Seattle Seahawks (@Seahawks) November 13, 2023  “Everybody know Tyler is ‘Tony Toe Tap,’” rookie receiver Jaxon Smith-Njigba said. “He’s been doing it for years. Always awesome every time he does it.” Lockett leads the Seahawks with four receiving touchdowns this year, and three have required the nine-year veteran to be precise about where he placed his feet at the catch point. In Detroit in Week 2 — before he caught the game winner in overtime — he finished a crossing pattern with a defender draped all over him in the back of the end zone. Against the Browns in Week 7, Lockett came through on an off-script, over-the-shoulder grab in that sweet spot in the south end zone of Lumen Field. “That little corner back there, we have to call it ‘Tyler’s Corner’ because he’s caught so many touchdowns back there,” quarterback Geno Smith said. Lockett is on pace for more than 900 yards and seven receiving touchdowns, and if he hits those marks, it would be the sixth straight season he’s done so. His consistency combined with a lack of individual accolades — he’s never made a Pro Bowl or All-Pro team as a receiver — contribute to Lockett being widely regarded as one of the league’s most underrated receivers. It’s a label Lockett doesn’t like, but it’s nonetheless appropriate. GO DEEPER Tyler Lockett and Quandre Diggs: The special bond between 2 overlooked Seahawks stars In Seattle, there’s no shortage of love for Lockett — especially when he’s gliding along the sideline for one of his signature toe taps. “Every time you see it, it’s like a wowing thing, man,” Smith said. For most of Lockett’s teammates and coaches, their introduction to his surreal sense of spatial awareness came in the first quarter of Seattle’s win over the Los Angeles Rams on “Thursday Night Football” in October 2019. That’s when Russell Wilson faked a handoff to running back Chris Carson, turned and scrambled over 24 yards before lofting a 13-yard touchdown pass to Lockett in the back left corner of that south end zone. The ball hung in the air for two seconds and traveled nearly 22 yards. Advertisement As Lockett awaited its arrival, he tracked it while being face-guarded by safety Eric Weddle. The ball sailed toward the back pylon, and Lockett cradled it with both hands, his “action green” Adidas cleats tapping the turf and his body in full extension with a slight tilt, reminiscent of  Michael Jackson’s gravity lean in “Smooth Criminal.” “You can’t get any better ball placement, toe tap and late hands,” receiver Cody Thompson said. “That’s the epitome, that clip.” A clip the Seahawks show often in meetings. One that never gets old. “It doesn’t matter how many times we watch that Rams clip in the back of the end zone,” quarterback Drew Lock said, “it’s still one of the sickest toe taps of all time.” TYLER LOCKETT DID THAT 😱 What a grab! @TDLockett12 📺: #LARvsSEA on FOX 📱: https://t.co/pfuFFe7HxS Learn how to watch: https://t.co/I6INVckndX pic.twitter.com/ccgdAuRLWl — NFL (@NFL) October 4, 2019  Lockett’s toe tap against the Rams — which, according to Next Gen Stats, had a completion probability of 5.3 percent — came in the fifth game of DK Metcalf’s rookie year. Metcalf had seen some of Lockett’s sideline work in practice, but that moment took it to the next level. “I found out quickly how serious he was with the toe tap,” Metcalf said. “You can never count Lock out when you throw him a jump ball or anything. He’ll go up and catch it and always get two feet in.” Sanjay Lal also quickly picked up on Lockett’s signature snags. A longtime receivers coach, Lal joined Seattle’s staff as a senior offensive assistant in 2020. He learned that Lockett’s catch against the Rams was as common an occurrence as a rainy day in Seattle. “What I didn’t realize: It’s every day,” said Lal, who spent a year with Jacksonville in 2021 before returning to the Seahawks as the receivers coach and passing game coordinator. “A lot of receivers, you see the splash play with the corner catch, the toes inbounds. You’re like, ‘OK, everyone has made one of those.’ But that’s him.” Advertisement Lockett is listed at 5 foot 10 and 182 pounds, not exactly the prototypical size for an elite toe-tapper. There are times he snags the ball at its highest point and drags his feet, as was the case on his 29-yard reception against the Eagles in the wild-card round of the 2019 playoffs, but Lockett prefers to let the ball come to him at just the right moment, before the defender can disrupt the timing. Lal explains the uniqueness of Lockett’s combination of body control and hand-eye coordination by pressing his sneakers together near the mesh point between the team’s practice field turf and the concrete. He stretches his arms toward the cement while motioning toward his outside shoulder, the spot where Lockett typically snags passes. “He’s made himself comfortable outside the framework,” Lal says. Receivers are taught to catch it toward their inside shoulder, where defenders struggle to poke it out. Lockett is uniquely adept at the opposite approach, which is unnatural for most other receivers. “He’s trained himself to make that catch,” Lal says. Lockett has developed a reputation for being automatic on these catches, particularly on crossing patterns in the red zone. In 2020, he beat Arizona cornerback Dre Kirkpatrick in the back of the end zone on fourth-and-2 in the fourth quarter. It was officially a 3-yard TD, but the ball traveled nearly 33 yards before Lockett dove, tracked it over his shoulder and got two hands while first tapping his left foot inbounds then dragging his right. The pass had a completion probability of 15.4 percent, according to Next Gen Stats, and most of his body was out of bounds when he completed the catch. Another well-known catch on Lockett’s highlight reel is his 4-yard touchdown on another crosser against the Panthers in Week 14 last season at Lumen Field. The ball traveled 32 yards, and Lockett was 0.7 yards from the back line that time, in nearly the exact spot as the Arizona catch. The routine was the same: track the ball over the shoulder, one foot down, then drag the other. TOE TAP TYLER 📺: #CARvsSEA on FOX📱: Stream on NFL+ https://t.co/VwP8oh9FMk pic.twitter.com/9vm65Z1598 — NFL (@NFL) December 11, 2022  “His feet almost go dead, and they drag along the ground as his momentum is still shifting,” tight end Noah Fant said. “That’s something that’s super special, takes a lot of practice and takes a lot of body control to be able to do that. Not very many people can do it like he does. That’s what is so special.” The ball Lockett caught in that same spot of the end zone at Ford Field in Week 2 against Detroit traveled 29 yards and had a completion probability of 33.6 percent, according to Next Gen Stats. And it was even tougher because cornerback Jerry Jacobs was draped all over him. Advertisement “It’s phenomenal. He’s unfazed by contact,” Lal said. The Seahawks teach receivers to play through contact, but for Lockett, it comes naturally. “When that ball is in the air, that’s all that’s in his mind: How do I separate, how do I get my hands on that ball and let my body do what he does naturally?” Last season, safety Julian Love defended a rare unsuccessful toe-tap attempt in Seattle’s Week 6 win over the Giants. Lockett ran a corner route and beat Love to the left sideline in the end zone on second-and-12 from the 21-yard line but couldn’t quite get both feet inbounds. But even that play showcased Lockett’s savvy. He gave Love “false hands” when they crossed the goal line, causing Love to jump as if the ball was coming. Then Lockett dropped his arms, kept running and shot them up again later. Love jumped again and Lockett tracked the ball over his shoulder while creating 1.3 yards of separation. “It’s little things like that that are kind of unorthodox and savvy of him,” Love said. “Thankfully, his toes were out of bounds.” When asked if other players have been able to mimic Lockett’s signature move, Lal replied with a firm “no.” But that doesn’t mean they aren’t trying. Thompson is always picking Lockett’s brain about that part of his game, either on the field or in the film room. Third-year receiver Cade Johnson is, too. Metcalf hasn’t borrowed the toe drag yet this season, but his touchdown against the Giants in Week 4 was the type of “late hands” catch Lockett has become famous for. Lockett’s influence is undoubtedly spreading across the receiver room. “He just leads by example,” Johnson said. “It’s one of those things where you’ve gotta just watch and let the magic happen.” Thus far, the best Lockett impression belongs to undrafted rookie Jake Bobo, whose two touchdowns this season looked like they came straight out of the Tyler Toe Tap handbook. Against the Panthers in Week 3, Bobo snatched Smith’s pass at the highest point in the back of the south end zone, shielded the ball from the defender and tapped both toes near the backline for a 5-yard touchdown. The encore in Week 7 versus Arizona was equally impressive: Bobo soared over cornerback Starling Thomas and corralled the pass with one hand while leaving barely any space between the Nike logo on his cleats and the sideline in the back corner of that same end zone. JAKE BOBO HAS JUST MADE THE MOST INSANE TOUCHDOWN CATCH YOU'LL SEE TODAY! 📺 FOX pic.twitter.com/lZaGVNieAE — Seattle Seahawks (@Seahawks) October 22, 2023  “I think now we can say Jake’s probably up there with Tyler when it comes down to the toe-drag swag,” Smith said. That’s the impact of having a great teacher. “I learned from the best in No. 16,” Bobo said. “Being able to watch him has been huge.” (Top photo: Todd Rosenberg / Getty Images) “The Football 100,” the definitive ranking of the NFL’s best 100 players of all time, is on sale now.

Jalen Brunson,“Noah Lyles Is Out Of His Mind”: Attack On Adidas & Anthony Edwards Triggers Basketball Fans And NBA Star Jalen Brunson,https://www.essentiallysports.com/nba-active-basketball-news-us-sports-noah-lyles-is-out-of-his-mind-attack-on-adidas-anthony-edwards-triggers-basketball-fans-and-nba-star-jalen-brunson/,"More Sports ES Fancast Aug 11, 2024 | 5:28 PM EDT Anthony Edwards vs. Noah Lyles—who's got it right in this heated debate? Track and field star, Noah Lyles doesn’t seem really happy despite winning a gold and a bronze medal at this year’s Olympics. He’s out there, taking it out on NBA stars; perhaps he can’t get enough. This time too, he wasn’t afraid of speaking his mind. Lyles attacked not just Anthony Edwards this time, but also Adidas with whom he’s had a good working relationship with since 2016. His reactions are getting backlash from not just fans but also NBA star Jalen Brunson. After Lyle’s successful completion of the Paris Olympics journey, a tweet started to go viral on X, regarding the entire Adidas-Edwards fiasco, with him mocking Edwards. Brunson couldn’t keep quiet and responded, “Damn I thought this was Centel.” Brunson was notably referring to the account as a fake one but once the social media user behind the account tweeted the entire incident Brunson realized that Lyles wasn’t in his best demeanor towards Edwards. Damn I thought this was Centel https://t.co/jgTuPK0JIH — Jalen Brunson (@jalenbrunson1) August 11, 2024 Expand Tweet ADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad  Is Noah Lyles out of his mind with his latest attack on Adidas? React! Reactions The roots of the problem began to sprout in 2023 when Lyles first attacked Adidas as he was invited by the brand to a shoe release for Edwards. Edwards had notably got a deal with Adidas and his AE1s were released in November that year. During that time Lyles was in negotiating with Adidas and was invited to the Minnesota Timberwolves star shoe release, which apparently didn’t go down with Lyles. Things went downhill as Lyles saw it as a minor gesture to appease him and questioned Edwards capabilities and whether he deserved his presence. In Lyle’s eyes, it was a major disparity. “You want to invite me to [an event for] a man who has not even been to an NBA Finals?” Lyles stated. Lyles then asked the billion-dollar company to give him a shoe deal by presenting his arguments. “And you’re giving him a shoe? No disrespect: the man is an amazing athlete. He is having a heck of a year. I appreciate that they saw his potential for success. All I’m asking is, ‘How could you not see that for me?” Lyles enumerated. As for the record, Edwards & Co. have made it to the conference Finals this passing NBA season which has been his best achievement in the NBA to date. Hence, it made Lyles question Adidas. Therefore, Brunson was joined by other fans who slammed Lyles. “even Jalen Brunson admitting Noah Lyles is out of his mind. you know it’s bad,” one fan commented. The user was pointing out that Brunson wasn’t satisfied with Lyles’s answer despite the fact that the two are compared oftentimes. “This is why I celebrated Noah not winning…,” another balling fan commented that he celebrated when Lyles failed to bag gold in the 200m. Notably, due to COVID-19 Lyles had to be satisfied with bronze in the 200m in this Olympics. ADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad “Nah Noah Lyles is just a world class hater,” another balling enthusiast stated. The user was most probably pointing out that Lyles had stated in August last year that ballers weren’t world champions where track and field athletes compete with the best stars from different countries. As per him, since the NBA is based mostly out of the USA, they didn’t deserve as much acclaim as Lyles. “Perhaps there was always a good reason people hated him. LMAO. His own peers in track think hes a fucking weirdo with the way he acts. Its not personal, he just makes unneccesary shitty comments bc hes a shitty person. It is what it is. Hes jealous, a pocket watcher, and BIG MAD,” another person criticized Lyles. The netizen was most probably pointing out the fact his peer Letsile Tebogo had called Lyles “arrogant” and “loud”, enumerating that these qualities were responsible for making him the world face of athletics. “Noah Lyles is kinda meh,” meanwhile one fan looked to support Lyles. As per him, Lyles deserved a deal with Adidas and was correct when he slammed Edwards. This year, Lyles inked an agreement with Adidas, which is said to be the most lucrative after Usain Bolt’s retirement.

USA Basketball’s selection process for the 2024 Paris Olympics hasn’t pleased many. The community, in the last few weeks, has witnessed memorable moments, snubs, and big-time controversies, we tell you. Along with bringing back LeBron James after he last played in 2012, Steph Curry and Anthony Edwards also made it to the roster. The issue arose when Derrick White was sent as Kawhi’s replacement instead of Jaylen Brown. 2016 gold medallist Kyrie Irving was also excluded, with 8 years younger Tyrese Haliburton. Despite the uproar and Draymond criticizing his own GSW coach, another ex-Warrior believes that what happened was for the best. DeMarcus Cousins and Quinn Cook discussed Tyrese Haliburton’s inclusion in the Team USA roster. Quinn initiated the topic, stating, “You need a guy who’s not gonna be mad when not playing.” This was an indirect dig at Jaylen Brown, as the Team USA roster was reportedly concerned whether “someone of Jaylen Brown’s caliber would accept having a significantly reduced role.” Therefore, with the team filled with dominating scorers like LeBron, KD, etc, the need was for a player who wouldn’t mind staying on the sidelines. “Obviously, Jaylen Brown, Kyrie Irving, from a talent perspective, and what they’ve done, even with their resumes, they’re supposed to be on the team. But when you’re putting a team together, just sometimes you need your Derrick White,” Quinn Cook said on Above The Rim with DH 12. “The topic of the basketball world has been ‘Jayson Tatum not playing’, yeah. If Derrick White don’t play, that’s expected.” ADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad Being the second-in-command in their respective franchises, both Jaylen Brown and Kyrie Irving are expected to carry the offensive effort, which grants them more on-court minutes. During the NBA Finals between the Boston Celtics and the Dallas Mavericks, Brown averaged 38.5 minutes throughout five games, while Irving averaged 39 minutes. While Derrick White himself wasn’t that far behind with his average of 36.7 minutes, his scoring wasn’t on par with that of his Celtics teammate and Mavericks rival.

Join Debate via Reuters Paris 2024 Olympics – Team USA Basketball arrivals at USA House – Team USA House, Paris, France – August 05, 2024. Derrick White of United States arrives at the USA House. REUTERS/Tingshu Wang During the 2016 Rio Olympics, Kyrie Irving went on to average 22.2 minutes over 8 games, with 17 minutes being used up to add only 4 points in the Finals against Serbia. In contrast, LeBron James has averaged 20.5 minutes at the Paris Olympics, while Kevin Durant just 19.6. Therefore, Irving’s previous record of taking up a bulk of the minutes, which may or may not generate the required points, may have played a role in his exclusion. After Jaylen Brown hinted that his exclusion from Team USA was because of his sour relationship with Nike, the team’s managing director Grant Hill was quick to come out with a response. He went on to state that “the responsibility that I have is to put together a team and a team that complements each other.” He had to decide on these grounds, even if it meant not taking in “Finals MVP.” As highlighted by Quinn Cook, the management simply may not have believed that taking in Jaylen Brown and/or Kyrie Irving would have been worthwhile if they had just remained on the sidelines. Another ex-NBA player, however, had a stronger reasoning, siding with the Celt’s Nike agenda and providing more reasons for the same. Now that we’ve opened this can of worms, let’s dive deeper. After Jaylen Brown made headlines for blaming Nike, reactions started to pour in from all sides. Many former NBA players, including Gilbert Arenas and Rashad McCants, agreed with the Celtics star’s sentiment. During a segment of his ‘Gil’s Arena’ podcast, the Wizards legend even went on to state that Team USA was allegedly a Nike Event that just sidelined players who aren’t a part of the billion-dollar brand. McCants highlighted that both players were, at one point in time, associated with the brand until complications arose. “Jaylen Brown sided with Kyrie Irving. He spoke out against Nike dropping Kyrie,” said McCants. “Nike dropped Kyrie after the post, Jaylen Brown didn’t like that, I think he was the President of the Players’ Association at the time, he was obligated to speak out about what Nike did, why they did it, he didn’t like it. He was wearing Kobes at the time, so he started covering up his Kobes.” USA Today via Reuters Jun 6, 2024; Boston, Massachusetts, USA; Boston Celtics guard Jaylen Brown (7) looks on in the third quarter against the Dallas Mavericks during game one of the 2024 NBA Finals at TD Garden. Mandatory Credit: David Butler II-USA TODAY Sports Back in 2022, Kyrie Irving suffered from repercussions after he posted antisemitic content online. This involved the Nets suspending him, and Nike ending the endorsement deal that they signed with the player in 2014. By that point, it had been 3 years since Irving had left the Celtics, and much of the Boston fanbase had turned against the player. ADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad Despite this, Brown, in his capacity as VP of the NBA Players Association, stated his disagreement with the terms that Irving needed to fulfill for his franchise suspension to be revoked. When it came to Nike, Brown took to his official X account, and wrote, “Since when did Nike care about ethics?” This, according to reports, is what soured the relationship between Nike and the 2024 NBA champion. After Grant Hill went on to state that Brown blaming Nike was just a ‘conspiracy theory’, the Celt had to remind him that as VP of the NBA Players Association, he has “a great understanding” of how things work. Brown and Irving may have been excluded from the 2024 roster simply because of the playing minutes issue. However, no one can deny the ‘fishy-ness’ that this happened with the duo, who were not on good terms with Nike.

Dan Marino,"Is the 1983 NFL Draft Class the Greatest Ever That Featured Hall of Famers John Elway, Jim Kelly & Dan Marino?",https://www.essentiallysports.com/nfl-active-news-is-the-ninteen-eighty-three-nfl-draft-class-the-greatest-ever-that-featured-hall-of-famers-john-elway-jim-kelly-dan-marino/,"More Sports ES Fancast Mar 26, 2024 | 9:46 AM EDT The 1983 NFL Draft has etched itself into football lore as potentially the greatest talent pool the league has ever seen. It was headlined by a trio of quarterbacks – John Elway, Jim Kelly, and Dan Marino – who would all end up immortalized in Canton. However, the greatness of this class goes beyond just its star power. From reshaping offensive philosophies to highlighting the importance of the QB position, the 1983 draft had a seismic impact that still echoes today. After more than 40 years, it’s worth examining if this class truly deserves the “greatest ever” moniker. Was it an anomaly of talent concentration, or a shifting of the tides that positioned the NFL for its current pass-happy era? Unraveling this enduring myth requires looking deeper than just individual accolades. ADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad On sheer numbers, 1983 has an undeniably compelling case. It produced a total of 8 Hall of Famers, including 3 first-ballot inductees at quarterback. Six quarterbacks were taken in the first round alone, both records that still stand. However, skeptics argue the depth was lacking beyond the premium picks. Where this class separates itself is the pronounced, lasting influence of its headliners, particularly the celebrated QB trio. John Elway’s draft day leverage set a new precedent, with his threat of baseball paving the way for prospects to truly choose their destination. More pivotally, Elway, Marino, and Kelly ushered in an era of prolific passing games that rendered the previous ground-and-pound norms obsolete. Marino’s record-shattering 1984 season crystallized the changing offensive philosophy. The installation of the K-Gun no-huddle by Kelly’s Bills further revolutionized gameplay. The draft’s ancillary impact, from protecting quarterbacks via rule changes to prioritizing receiver weapons and left tackle blindside protectors, cannot be understated. If the test of a draft’s greatness is re-shaping the sport itself, the 1983 class seemingly checks that box. However, its mythical importance stems from something priceless – passing the torch from the old guard to a new generation of transcendent talents who left an indelible legacy. For all the deserved adulation of the 1983 draft’s quarterback trifecta, their true genius was the longevity and consistent excellence they demonstrated over nearly two decades. USA Today via Reuters Apr 29, 2021; Cleveland, Ohio, USA; Jamin Davis (Kentucky) with NFL commissioner Roger Goodell over video call after being selected by the Washington Football Team as the number 19 overall pick in the first round of the 2021 NFL Draft at First Energy Stadium. Mandatory Credit: Kirby Lee-USA TODAY Sports Elway, Kelly, and Marino combined for 17 Pro Bowl selections. From 1984-1993, they represented the AFC in 9 of 10 Super Bowls, with Kelly’s Bills making an unprecedented four straight appearances. Statistically, Marino launched a cosmic shift – his 1984 season of 5,084 yards and 48 TDs were records untouched for 20+ years. ADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad Beyond the individual numbers, this trio’s collective influence remolded expectations and strategies forever. Teams soon realized pylons, not running backs, were the centerpiece of elite offenses. The hunt for franchise quarterbacks intensified like never before.

The gameplay sped up with no-huddle approaches. Skelly’s K-Gun evolved into the modern hurry-up, which remains a pivotal strategic wrinkle. Defenses were forced to deploy extra defensive backs and sacrifice size for speed to counter aerial attacks. ADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad In redefining what it meant to be an elite quarterback, Elway, Kelly, and Marino became the standard-bearers for a new era. They are appropriately dubbed the legendary Class of 1983. Yet their impact went far beyond that – they permanently reshaped how football itself is played and consumed. For that reason alone, this class has an undeniable claim as the greatest of all time.

Kim’s candor, bold persona, and careless brashness all made him seem tailormade for the breakaway side. LIV Golf certainly wasn’t spendthrift in marketing Kim’s return. In fact, Greg Norman himself teased Kim’s return. But why does a league that just scored its biggest draw and boasts two reigning Major champions need Kim, who last played a Major in 2011? Does LIV Golf need a new poster boy? Was a still-vivacious comparison between Tiger Woods and Anthony Kim also tempting the Great White Shark? ADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad Anthony Kim was expected to take the mantle from Tiger Woods. Not the mantle of 14 Majors that Woods raked in then. While many expected Kim to reach double digits with majors, it was still a little early. Kim was expected to take on the mantle of being the Tour’s poster boy.  Let’s also not forget the time of Kim’s appearance. The PGA Tour plunged headlong into the post-Woods era after the sun of Tiger Woods seemed to be waning. Rory McIlroy, too, was yet to storm the Stateside with sheer force. Kim burst into the scene after making much noise in the Walker Cup and collegiate golf. Turning pro at 21, Kim played in two PGA Tour events in 2006, bagging a runner-up finish in his debut. The next season was a hint at what was to come. With ten top-25 finishes from his 26 outings, Kim landed in 2008. That year, the rising star became the first golfer since Tiger Woods to win two events in the same season before turning 25.  🗓 May 4th, 2008. Fan favourite Anthony Kim becomes a PGA TOUR winner at the Wachovia Championship (Wells Fargo).pic.twitter.com/czcbhriK4d — GOLFTV (@GOLFTV) May 19, 2020 Expand Tweet  A chance at the 2008 Ryder Cup team followed. Kim stomped Valhalla, subjecting Sergio Garcia, Europe’s leading point scorer in the biennial showdown, to a 5&4 humiliation. Kim was 0nly the third player, alongside Phil Mickelson and Jim Furyk, to rank within the top 10.  To put that into more context, he was the only player under 25 and the third player under 30. But it’s not his achievements alone that made him part of the lore. Rather, what Kim represented stood higher than what he achieved on the greens.  Paul Azinger, Kim’s US team captain, said the rookie Ryder Cupper was their “off-the-course team leader.” Azinger recounted, “He wanted Sergio all week… He kept saying, ‘I want to play Sergio, Zing. I want to play Sergio.’ It never worked out until Sunday, and we got lucky. Anthony ate it up and responded. He said on the first tee, ‘I’m going to whup his a** for you today, Captain.’ That aggressiveness was what the golf world was looking for after Tiger Woods. That brash and raw talent, and the sheer nonchalance in the face of intense pressure, made Anthony Kim an instant hit. Azinger added, “He was pointing at me, and if you can read his lips, he was saying, ‘I told you I was going to whup his a**!’” Kim was a hotshot descended on the greens, rocking belt buckles with his initials carved on them. Decked from head-to-toe on Nike apparel, it was a rather unthinkable sight but one that fans loved. via Imago Ryder Cup rookie, Anthony Kim signed autographs between holes during the practice round for the Ryder Cup at Valhalla Golf Club on Tuesday September 16, 2008 in Lexington, KY. Photo by Mark Cornelison Staff 6568 Kentucky News – September 16, 2008 – ZUMAl61_ And, before anyone saw it coming, Anthony Kim went to the ‘Jay Leno Show’ to offer Jessica Alba a putting lesson. Not the only crossover he would do in his short career. Only weeks after that, Kim was at the NBA Celebrity All-Stars Game, notching two assists in the fourth quarter for the West team under Magic Johnson. Similar to his crashing like a meteor, the three-time PGA Tour winner vanished like a comet within two years of that.  That mystery definitely added to the lore. “Golf Yeti,” veteran sportswriter Alan Shipnuck dubbed Kim. Seemingly, Greg Norman wanted the combination of these two: a star who can pull the crowd and someone who, given a chance, can still perform reasonably well. Will it pay off? Arguably, Kim is likely to rake in more eyeballs than Rahm did in his debut. How well that translates to the later games depends on how well and how fast Kim comes back in form. There have already been speculations about whether the comeback hero can score a sub-70 in his first round at LIV Golf Jeddah. In his last round as a professional, Kim carded 74 at the 2012 Wells Fargo Championship.  The most birdies in one round at the Masters. It's been 10 years since Anthony Kim's historic day.  🐦🐦🐦🐦🐦🐦🐦🐦🐦🐦🐦 What a round. What a belt buckle.#LiveUnderPar pic.twitter.com/hHA5XWIjYx — PGA TOUR (@PGATOUR) April 10, 2019 Expand Tweet ADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad  Let’s also not forget that golf’s landscape has changed a lot in the years since then. With it, the techniques have also changed. Suddenly, speed training is all the rage. Drives carry more weight than ever. So much so that the USGA and R&A have both jointly brought forth a golf ball rollback policy.  Adapting his drive perhaps won’t cause too much trouble for Kim. He used to average around 294–300 yards against the Tour average of 285-290 yards during his heyday. But 12 years of hiatus is a tough thing to brush aside in one fell stroke. Ben Flaming at the Independent revealed that only two—Rory McIlroy and Phil Mickelson—from the world’s top 10 when Kim left playing are still in the top 200. Furthermore, only two players from that famed 2008 Ryder Cup team have full status on the PGA Tour.  ADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad Read More: ‘[Anthony Kim] Made 10 Birdies’: Veteran Caddie Drops Major Bombshell Days Before LIV Golf Jeddah Read More: “He Loves That Controversy”: When Anthony Kim’s Never-Before-Seen Side Got Revealed by Tour Colleague in 2020 EssentiallySports is a digital-first sports media house that surfaces the best stories on America's favorite sports celebrities with a fan's perspective to 30+ M average monthly readers.

Matt Harvey,Ex-Met Matt Harvey starts career at NYC real estate Newmark,https://nypost.com/2023/06/15/ex-met-matt-harvey-starts-career-at-nyc-real-estate-newmark/,"Former Mets pitching ace Matt Harvey is now pitching loans. Harvey, who quit the sport last month after a tempestuous 10-year career, has quietly joined commercial real estate firm Newmark as managing director of its multifamily debt origination and advisory unit,  The Post has learned. A source said Harvey’s job will be to develop new client relationships while he undergoes a “crash course” as part of the powerhouse Capital Markets Strategies division. “I’ve always been interested in the many different aspects of real estate,” Harvey told The Post. “By joining an incredibly successful firm such as Newmark, I will be able to learn and grow from some of the best in the industry.” Newmark told The Post in a statement, “Matt’s high-profile career has given him tremendous exposure to industry professionals and his position will allow him to expand the group’s footprint in the tristate region. “Matt has already hit the ground running, meeting with clients and colleagues and deploying his team-building skills to the multifamily and commercial financing sector.” Harvey, who earned the moniker of “The Dark Knight,” helped pitch the Mets to the World Series in 2015, their first Fall Classic since losing to the Yankees in 2000.  They also fell short against the Royals in 2015, and Harvey’s superstar trajectory was soon derailed by injuries and an MLB suspension for drug use.  He pitched for four teams after the Mets traded him in 2018 and last appeared in the majors in 2021. Harvey, 34, landed the plum position at one of the world’s largest commercial real estate brokerages and service firms thanks to his relationship with lifelong Mets fan Anthony Orso, the president of Capital Markets Strategies.  The two met in 2013, Harvey’s second season with the Mets, when the rising star helped Orso’s son Steven with his knuckleball during a bullpen session at Citi Field. Orso had co-founded Cantor Commercial Real Estate — Cantor Fitzgerald’s commercial and multifamily real estate finance company, which closed over $50 billion in loans during Orso’s tenure as CEO — before joining Newmark. Harvey participated in Cantor’s many charitable programs, Orso recalled.  “And sort of coincidentally, I had a friend who had a box at Citi Field who was friends with Matt’s parents in Mystic, Ct.,” said Orso, an Amazin’  fan since since the Miracle Mets won the Worlds Series in 1969.  A few months ago, another Newmark executive who knew Harvey told Orso about the pitcher’s plans to hang up his cleats. “I felt bad. He’s such a great guy. I knew he had a lot of surgeries,” Orso said.  Orso soon offered him a job in his division, which specializes in complex real estate financings, private equity placements and restructuring advisory services, and Harvey reported for work at the firm’s 125 Park Ave. headquarters.   “He’s in the office early, working all day” and often out with clients at night, Orso said. This week, Harvey took clients to the “Subway Series” at Citi Field.  “What client doesn’t want to go there with Matt Harvey?” Orso mused. As for whether the former starter will thrive in his new role as a closer, Orso predicted, “He’ll be very successful.”  Advertisement"

Arena. Mandatory Credit: Geoff Burke-USA TODAY Sports Is Tyus Jones the missing piece for a championship team, or just another solid role player? For Minnesotans, the name Tyus Jones is equivalent to what LeBron James is to basketball. “Before he [Tyus] was a junior in high school, if you typed Apple Valley into Google, it showed up Apple Valley, California. Now it shows up Apple Valley, Minnesota,” the Wizards’ guard’s older half-brother, Jadee Jones, said in 2017. Clearly, the impact of the second of the Jones boys was far and wide-reaching. And why wouldn’t it? The 28-year-old was practically a legend in his hometown! So much so that the Mayor of Apple Valley declared April 22nd as “Tyus Jones Day,” after the Duke product led his team to an NCAA title in 2015 and entered the NBA Draft. Then again, it shouldn’t come as a surprise, we suppose. Jones is, after all, part of a rich basketball heritage. ADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad If you ask Tyus who was the most influential figure in his basketball arc, he’d immediately point to Jadee. 10 years older than Tyus, he was pretty much fluctuating between being a father figure and a friend. A former Division I basketball player, Jadee’s dream of being a basketball trainer took off with Tyus and his younger brother Tre Jones. Having graduated from Mankato in 2009 with a degree in Health and Exercise Science, he arrived just in time to help Tyus. Poll 1 of 4  What should Tyus Jones prioritize in his next NBA contract?

He’s someone who is extremely smart, knows the game, studies the game, and knows the body. I’m thankful to have an older brother like that in my corner,” Tyus Jones once recounted. By now, you must have gotten an idea of who Tre is.     A post shared by Tyus Jones (@1tyus)  Aside from being the younger brother of Mr. Minnesota Basketball, the youngest Jones is also part of the San Antonio Spurs. The 24-year-old was selected as the 41st pick in the 2020 Draft Night. Both brothers are Duke alums. If you thought this was all the Jones brothers, then we have another surprise for you. There is a third half-brother, Reggie Bunch, a 6’6 forward who played at Robert Morris University. You can relax now. No more surprises. But Tyus’ basketball lineage does not end here. His father, Rob Jones, competed at Division III Wisconsin-Parkside while his mother Debbie, was a state title holder in North Dakota as a point guard. Jones also has an aunt, Darcy Cascaes, who won two championships with Devils Lake High School and was an all-conference guard at the University of North Dakota. And yet another prominent Minnesota face, Al Nuness, Jones’ uncle, was the captain of the Minnesota Gophers in the 1960s. The eldest son of Al, Jared Nuness, Tyus’ cousin, was just as good on a basketball court as the rest of the family. We are well and truly done with the roots section of Tyus Jones. And now, let’s move to his accolades. What were you and I doing in eighth grade? Yeah, think about that for a moment while we tell you what Tyus did. He was the varsity starter for Apple Valley High School, averaging 16.8 points and 8.1 assists per game, successfully leading the team to a 20-8 record and starting in every one of them. Yup! Let that seep in. So we ask you again – what were you doing as an eighth grader? He continued in his starting point guard position for five years with Apple Valley and led them to their first state title. Furthermore, Jones won the AAU national championship and three gold medals with USA Basketball in 2011, 2012, and 2014. There was no doubt that he’d be the McDonald’s All-American in 2014, either. And of course, in the process with Duke, he won the national championship, earning the NCAA Tournament’s Most Outstanding Player award. But that wasn’t all. He was also named to the Final Four Most Outstanding Player.     A post shared by Tyus Jones (@1tyus)  Not too soon after, Tyus was selected as the first-round 24th pick in 2015 Draft Night. Although he was selected by the Cleveland Cavaliers, almost like a dream come true, Tyus was traded to the Minnesota Timberwolves that very night in return for Cedi Osman, Rakeem Christmas, and a 2019 2nd-round pick. A month after that, the Wolves signed Jones to a 2-year $2.62 million contract, alternating his time between Minnesota and the Idaho Stampede, the D League affiliate of the Utah Jazz. A year later, Minnesota proceeded to exercise the team option, signing Tyus Jones to a $1.4 million option for 2017-2018. This repeated the next year, as the Wolves once again exercised the $2.44 million option for the 2018-19 season. And for the last time, in 2019, Minnesota extended the $3.57 million qualifying offer, as the young guard became a restricted free agent. On July 11, 2019, Tyus said an emotional goodbye to his hometown team and joined the Memphis Grizzlies on a 3-year $26.4 million contract. He spent almost 3.5 years with the Grizzlies before he was traded to Washington as part of a three-team trade. ADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad     A post shared by Tyus Jones (@1tyus)  In July 2022, he signed a two-year $29 million contract with Memphis. Although he was set to be an unrestricted free agent in the 2024-25 season, Tyus Jones made it clear that if the Wizards would have him back, he would be more than happy to return to DC. His family loves the place and more importantly, he believes he can finally play a starting guard instead of a backup. ADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad For now, though, Tyus remains one of the hottest free agents remaining. And while the Lakers are encouraged to pursue him, so far there haven’t been any updates on any such moves. If Los Angeles does have any such plans, they’d better act fast. Someone of Tyus Jones’ caliber isn’t likely to stay free for long. The loaded free agency this year certainly had put him at a disadvantage. Given how that noise has subsided, the former Duke product won’t find himself short of suitors for long.

Arjen Robben,Manchester United told current player's potential could make him their Arjen Robben,https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/manchester-united-arjen-robben-antony-27579759,"Former Manchester United striker Louis Saha believes Antony has the potential to be the Reds' Arjen Robben. Bayern Munich and Chelsea legend Robben enjoyed a glittering career at European football's highest level. The 39-year-old was known for his trademark cut inside onto his left foot before fizzing a shot towards goal. Like Robben, Antony prefers cutting inside to beat his man. However, he has yet to find the same form as the legendary Dutchman and has a big season ahead of him to prove his worth to the Old Trafford faithful. Speaking to Paddy Power, Saha believes the Brazilian has what it takes to reach the same heights as Robben but will need to improve his performances. ""Antony has that Arjen Robben style about him where he cuts in the from the right-hand side and hits it with his left foot,"" he explained. ALSO READ: Antony set goal target for the upcoming season ""Whenever he goes onto his right foot it’s a surprise. He’s strong physically and he can get frustrated, but it’s not just him not playing well, the whole Manchester United team isn’t playing well. The team is not performing the way we want. ""There is a lack of speed and lack of one-on-one situations created for the attacking players. This means that Antony doesn’t have many other options other than dribbling, which makes it a bit more difficult for him. The design team have delved deep into the Old Trafford archives and found inspiration in the jersey worn during the triumphant FA Cup-winning season of 1908/09. The result is a striking adidas ensemble that effortlessly stands out both on the terraces and on the pitch. Prices start from £40 ""That's why when the overall performance improves, we’ll see talented players like Bruno [Fernandes], [Jadon] Sancho, [Marcus] Rashford and like Antony to perform better. Yes, Antony can improve the diversity of his attacks, that’s always been my point. Arjen Robben for example, if you compare him and Antony, Robben had a similar style but also one of his strengths was having the capacity to go both ways, if Antony finds a way to do this, he will be sorted.""

Buddy Hield,Buddy Hield 'Ready' to Finally Make the Playoffs After 76ers' Win vs. Heat,https://www.givemesport.com/philadelphia-76ers-buddy-hield-playoff-debut/,"Your changes have been saved  Email is sent Email has already been sent Please verify your email address. You’ve reached your account maximum for followed topics.                     The Philadelphia 76ers came away from the NBA's Play-In Tournament with the 7-seed in the Eastern Conference as the 76ers defeated the Miami Heat in a 105-104 nail-biter on Wednesday night.
                         Philadelphia trailed by as much as 16 against Miami's vaunted defense, but an injury to Heat star guard/forward Jimmy Butler, second-half heroics from the reigning NBA MVP Joel Embiid, and sizzling three-point shooting from 76ers forward Nicolas Batum contributed to the 76ers' victory. For Batum, he showed a national TV audience that he still has gas left in the tank during his seventeenth NBA season.
                         The New York Knicks await Philadelphia in the first round of the NBA playoffs as the East's 2-seed, though many are considering Philadelphia to be the favorite in the upcoming series.
                         Though Wells Fargo Center was completely packed with 76er faithful, no one in the building was more excited about a clinched playoff berth than 76ers shooting guard Buddy Hield. Hield, touted as one of the NBA's premier three-point shooters, made massive plays for Philadelphia to help seal the victory, even though his shot wasn't falling. Hield dished out six assists, which was tied for the team lead with All-Star 76ers guard Tyrese Maxey.
                         The 31-year-old marksman, in his eighth NBA season, had long been awaiting his time to help his team make a post-season push, and he was visibly jolly after the game concluded. Hield took a moment to talk with 76ers team reporter Lauren Rosen for a celebratory post-game interview, where Rosen asked him his thoughts on going to the NBA playoffs for the first time.
                         ""I'm just glad we got the win. I'm glad I can go to the playoffs for the first time. I'm ready.""
                          Buddy Hield was selected as the 6th overall pick in the 2016 NBA Draft by the New Orleans Pelicans. New Orleans chose Hield to help lead the team to new heights. The former Oklahoma Sooner was looked at as one of the best scorers in the country, averaging 25 points on a blistering 45.7 percent three-point shooting percentage in his senior season.
                         New Orleans took a chance on the older Hield, drafting him at the age of 23 and heading into his rookie season. The Pelicans, only three years removed from a rebrand that saw the team change from their previous New Orleans Hornets moniker and likeness, hoped that Hield would be a part of the development of a team culture.
                         This vision would not come to last long, as the Pelicans would trade a rookie Hield to the Sacramento Kings in 2017 for a package that involved four-time NBA All-Star center DeMarcus Cousins. This was after a promising rookie year which saw Hield average 10.6 points on 39.1 percent shooting from distance.
                         After arriving in Sacramento and playing another four seasons for the franchise, he was then flipped again in 2021-22 mid-season to the Indiana Pacers. Hield's tenure with Sacramento was an incredibly productive one, averaging a career-high 20.7 points on 42.7 percent three-point shooting in 2018-19, finishing fourth in Most Improved Player voting that season.
                         Hield averaged 17.5 points in those four full seasons as a King. Hield was continuously proving himself to be one of the most prolific and highly sought-after shooters in the entire league, connecting on made three-pointer number 1,000 in his 350th career game, setting a new NBA record for fastest player in NBA history to 1,000 career threes. This record would stand from March 1, 2021, until March 18, 2024, when Duncan Robinson completed the feat in just seven fewer games.

                         Hield's career as an Indiana Pacer would only lead to more accomplishments as he knocked down three-pointer number 1,500 on December 5, 2022, becoming the second-fastest player to reach that mark, only behind the all-time leader in three-pointers made, Stephen Curry. Hield currently sits just 76 three-pointers away from 2,000 for his career.
                         After another season-and-a-half in Indiana, Hield was then traded mid-season for the third time in his career, this time to the Philadelphia 76ers, where he is currently thrilled to be playing. Shortly after his arrival in Philadelphia three months ago, he talked to reporters about his third mid-season trade, the whirlwind of events that led to him becoming a member of the 76ers, and how excited he was to begin his tenure in Philadelphia.
                         ""(Being traded mid-season) it's not something I'm not used to...I'm just happy to be a Sixer. I've been watching the Sixers my whole life...I'm just happy to be here and be around the city.""
                         Buddy Hield and the Philadelphia 76ers will match up against Jalen Brunson and the New York Knicks in the first round of the 2024 NBA Playoffs, with Game 1 set to begin on Saturday, April 20, at 6 PM ET. National broadcast coverage is provided by ESPN.

During a recent episode of the Thanalysis Show, Giannis revealed that Adidas offered him a sneaker deal, but not Thanasis as they had originally planned. “He brought the contract and put it in front of me, and I’m like, ‘Okay, great, where is my brother’s?’ And he was like, ‘We’re not going to sign your brother’s today. You’re going to sign yours and then we’re going to bring your brother in a week to sign his.’ And I was like, ‘Nuh-uh, no, thank you,'” Giannis recalled.

In the Thanalysis Show, the Bucks star revealed that his family was in a place of need, and he would have accepted even “toilet paper and some cash next to it.” However, the Adidas executive was aware of his family’s financial situation and tried to take advantage by offering an underwhelming contract. But it all worked out for the Antetokounmpo family in the end. ADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad Nike approached the Greek player just as he started his journey in the NBA. At first, Giannis had some misgivings, since he had worn Adidas all his life. But a call with Susan Mulders of Nike Basketball cleared any such doubts. When Giannis explained that it was a “family thing” for him, meaning his brother, mother, and the rest of his family came as a package deal with him, she agreed to offer both him and Thanasis a sneaker deal. The next thing we know, Antetokounmpo signed his first sneaker deal in 2013. They later agreed to an extension in 2017, which included a signature sneaker line. The Nike Zoom Freak line was launched in June 2019, and with five sneakers already on the market, it shows no signs of slowing down.

Oftentimes, the forward has been ridiculed as fans cite nepotism as the reason he is still a player in the NBA. However, that doesn’t detour him from being his best self on the floor. Giannis is his brother’s number 1 supporter and has always been there to silence haters on his behalf to help him play the game without the noise. The same happened today as Giannis took to his Instagram to share something. With this one move, the center has managed to provide the best answer to anyone who still doubts his brother’s skills. ADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad Rather than Thanasis’s on-court flopping or funny meme, a page put together a highlight reel of his best moments on the hardwood. The Greek Freak quickly reposted it on his story, with two simple shushing emojis, silencing the haters once and for all. In the reel, Thanasis is seen dunking, blocking shots, and being extremely effective on the floor.     A post shared by Overtime Europe (@overtimeeur)  This is not the only way Giannis has responded to haters today. Earlier, he made a tribute to his dear brother, who gave it all for him, a special dedication in line with the upcoming 2024 All-Star games. An Instagram post revealed the center’s appreciation for his older brother sharing, “Giannis’ “All-Star” Nike Zoom Freak 5s are dedicated to his brother Thanasis.” While the gesture in itself may be sweet, the reason behind this is heart-breaking.     A post shared by Bleacher Report (@bleacherreport)  On the shoe, one will find the words, “Thanasis, thanks for sharing.” This is a callback to the time the brother spent training in Greece. Owing to their family situation, the two had to share the same pair of shoes, taking turns wearing them during practice sessions and later in games. Times have changed, and they can afford anything they’d like right now. Still, Giannis has not forgotten the sacrifices his older brother made to make his dream come true. In the midst of all this, Thanasis remains rest assured in his talents, not bothered by all the noise. ADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad Read More: Wild Scenes Erupt in Utah as Giannis Antetokounmpo Taking a Nasty Shot to Face Causes Heated Brawl In an interview with Donatas Urbonas of Basket News, Thanasis expressed that only the truth has the power to affect him. He added that he is not bothered by individuals suggesting that his presence in the NBA is solely due to his relation to Giannis. “Everybody has their opinion, but the only time it hurts you is when it’s true,” Thanasis said. He further added, “If it’s true, it hurts you, but at the same time, if you know my journey. … Bro, I didn’t have what to eat. Who cares about an article? I didn’t have anything to eat. I’m a son of immigrants.” ADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad In the end, in something that almost seems straight out of a movie, the sons of struggling immigrants are now completely reaping the benefits of the American Dream.  Watch This Story –  Presenting the Teams Who Are Yet To Taste the Glory of World Series EssentiallySports is a digital-first sports media house that surfaces the best stories on America's favorite sports celebrities with a fan's perspective to 30+ M average monthly readers.

David James,US election latest: Was Biden's timing deliberate - and is there any truth to Michelle Obama theories? | Join live Q&A with our experts,https://news.sky.com/story/us-election-latest-was-bidens-timing-deliberate-and-is-there-any-truth-to-michelle-obama-theories-join-live-qanda-with-our-experts-13177655,"Likely Democratic nominee Vice President Kamala Harris's meeting with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu follows his talks with President Joe Biden. It comes as a new poll shows Ms Harris has narrowed the gap against Donald Trump. Friday 26 July 2024 02:41, UK Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player US vice president Kamala Harris has said she raised serious concerns with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu about the scale of human suffering
in Gaza. ""I made clear my serious concern about the dire
humanitarian situation there,"" she said. ""I will not be silent,"" she added following talks at the White House. Ms Harris said ""we cannot look away"" from what was happening in the war-torn Palestinian territory as she called for a ceasefire deal to free hostages still being held by Hamas. Ms Harris also said: ""Israel has a right to defend itself. And how it does so
matters."" The talks have been closely watched by commentators for signs of how the expected Democratic presidential nominee might
shift American policy about Israel if she becomes president.
 Her remarks to reporters after the talks were sharp and serious in tone,
reflecting what could be a shift from President Joe Biden in how
she deals with Mr Netanyahu. Family members of American hostages being held captive in Gaza held ""productive and honest"" talks with Joe Biden and Benjamin Netanyahu today. Gathered outside the White House, relatives said they are more optimistic about a deal to release their loved ones than they have been in months. ""We got absolute commitment from the Biden administration and from Prime Minister Netanyahu that they understand the urgency of this moment,"" they said. Jonathan Dekel-Chen, whose son Sagui was taken by Hamas from Kibbutz Nir Oz on 7 October, told the Times of Israel that there was pressure building on Mr Netanyahu. ""I think the prime minister understands that not only are the eyes of the world on Hamas right now, they’re also on him,"" he said. ""Because so many different sides — both within Israel, but also outside of Israel — are saying the conditions are there."" Kamala Harris and Benjamin Netanyahu have begun talks in Washington. The Israeli prime minister met with Joe Biden earlier where the president reiterated his calls for Israel and Hamas to quickly agree to a ceasefire deal that would bring hostages home. Ms Harris's meeting with Mr Netanyahu is seen to be even more important than the one with Mr Biden after the president ended his bid for re-election and endorsed the VP. She is also expected to press Israel's leader on securing a deal to release the hostages kidnapped during Hamas’ 7 October attack on Israel that launched the war. ""I look forward to our conversation. We have a lot to talk about,"" Ms Harris said in greeting Mr Netanyahu, echoing the president almost word-for-word  ""We do indeed,"" Mr Netanyahu replied. About 29 million people watched Joe Biden’s televised Oval Office address last night, according to American data firm Nielsen.  The TV viewership for the 11-minute speech was slightly higher than the 25.4 million people who tuned in for Donald Trump’s acceptance speech at the Republican National Convention last week. Mr Biden, who rebuffed weeks of pressure from Democrats to step aside, said: ""I've decided the best way forward is to pass the torch to a new generation. That's the best way to unite our nation."" Israelis will be paying close attention to Kamala Harris' meeting with Benjamin Netanyahu today, says international correspondent John Sparks. Israel's prime minister met with Joe Biden today, where the president was expected to push Mr Netanyahu to finalise a ceasefire deal in Gaza that would see hostages returned to their families. White House officials said the deal was ""closer now than we've been before"" but that ""gaps remain"" between parties. Mr Biden brought family members of hostages with him into his meeting with Mr Netanyahu in an attempt to apply pressure on the Israeli leader to get a deal completed. Mr Netanyahu is meeting with Ms Harris in a separate meeting.  The vice president chose not to attend the Israeli's address to Congress yesterday, and there is uncertainty about where she stands on policy toward Israel. ""[Israelis] will be looking very carefully at Kamala Harris,"" says Sparks.  ""What's her position going to be on Israel in the event that she becomes the US president? ""She has been more willing to talk about the scale, the sheer scale of human suffering in Gaza than President Biden has.  ""So there'll be watching that meeting very carefully."" Kamala Harris says she is ""ready"" to debate former president Donald Trump. Ms Harris is on her way to being named as the Democratic Party's candidate to face Mr Trump in November's presidential election. She is in Washington to meet with Israeli leader Benjamin Netanyahu today and, speaking to reporters beforehand, said: ""I'm ready, let's go."" ""I have agreed to the previously agreed upon 10 September debate,"" she said after landing at Joint Base Andrews.  ""He agreed to that previously. I think the voters deserve to see the split screen that exists in this race on the debate stage."" The upcoming US election could be among the closest fought in generations. The latest New York Times/Siena College poll shows that, among likely voters, Donald Trump leads Kamala Harris 48%-47% in a head-to-head match. This is a marked improvement for the Democrats compared to the Times/Siena poll in early July that saw Joe Biden behind by six percentage points. That came in the aftermath of the poor debate performance which would eventually drive him from the presidential race. Mr Trump leads Ms Harris 48%-46% among registered voters. He had led among registered voters by nine percentage points over Mr Biden in the post-debate poll. Voters are seemingly becoming more tuned into the presidential race. Just before the June debate, only 48% of voters said they were paying attention to the campaigns. That figure now stands at 64%. The poll of 1,142 registered voters was conducted following Joe Biden's decision to not seek re-election. It has a margin of error of 3.3 percentage points. If you haven't already heard the phrase 'border tsar' levied against Kamala Harris, the chances are you will do soon. The moniker is quickly becoming the favourite attack line from Republicans trying to tarnish Ms Harris's reputation on immigration. Searches for the term have spiked this year, as per Google Trends data, while Donald Trump's campaign chief has acknowledged it's the party's best line of attack against Ms Harris. Republicans have adopted it more and more in recent weeks. ""Kamala had one job,"" Nikki Haley told the crowd at the party's National Convention in Milwaukee this month.  ""One job. And that was to fix the border. Now imagine her in charge of the entire country."" This week, Mr Trump's running mate JD Vance said: ""The border crisis is a Kamala Harris crisis."" And speaking last night in North Carolina, Mr Trump himself said: ""Under border tsar Harris, millions of aliens are pouring into the country."" The label is starting to stick to Ms Harris like glue, but where does the term come from, and is it fair? Biden's thankless task The term has its roots back in March 2021, when Joe Biden announced he would be giving Ms Harris the task of coordinating diplomatic relationships to address the ""root causes"" of migration into the US. It appeared to be a thankless task. The assignment was a long-term one. Nobody in the White House was expecting the vice president to solve border surges quickly. At best, any benefits from addressing these root causes would take time to appear. At worst, Ms Harris would become the face of the border crisis, one of the biggest political vulnerabilities of the Biden administration.  Is Harris in charge? From the moment Ms Harris was given her new task, she was described as the person ""in charge of the migration crisis"" by the media. But this isn't true. That job belongs to - and always has belonged to - the secretary of homeland security, Alejandro Mayorkas, and the secretary of health and human services, Xavier Becerra. Ms Harris was never put in charge of the border or immigration policy, nor was she involved in overseeing law-enforcement efforts responding to the crisis. The White House had to field frequent questions on what Ms Harris's role exactly defined but that sometimes proved tricky. At one point, senior officials said Ms Harris would ""oversee a whole-of-government approach"" to dealing with migration. Harris's missteps At the same time, it didn't help that Ms Harris made some gaffes that would come back to bite her. She was criticised by immigrant rights activists for a speech in June 2021 in which she urged ""folks in this region who are thinking about making that dangerous trek to the United States-Mexico border: Do not come. Do not come"". She was also repeatedly criticised for not visiting the US-Mexico border and for a confusing interview with NBC's Lester Holt in which she dismissed questions about it. A record that speaks for itself The irony here - and the one that Ms Harris'd campaign team will be desperately trying to push - is that her record on immigration throughout her career has been widely praised. Her first ever bill as a senator was to give immigrants detained while trying to enter the country access to lawyers. That came shortly after Mr Trump had enacted a travel ban on citizens from Muslim-majority countries. She also publicly supported the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program that protects undocumented youth brought to the United States as children from deportation. As a prosecutor, she opposed federal legislation that would have criminalised providing legal assistance to unauthorised immigrants. As vice president her task has been tough, but June 2024 saw the lowest number of illegal border crossings into America since January 2021. Will anything change? Probably not.  As shown by Mr Trump's rally in North Carolina last night, the term isn't going anytime soon. Immigration is a top concern for US voters, and it might serve Ms Harris well to make a clear pitch on how she will deal with the issue if she becomes president.  There are still ""gaps that remain"" in talks over a ceasefire-hostage release proposal between Israel and Hamas, according to the White House. Joe Biden and Benjamin Netanyahu have been in talks today where key elements, including the fate of the hostages, are being discussed. ""There are gaps that remain,"" said White House spokesperson John Kirby. ""We believe that they are of a nature that can be closed, and we can achieve a deal.  ""But it will require, as it always does, some leadership, some compromise, and some effort to get there."" Mr Kirby also repeated a claim made by Mr Netanyahu during his address to Congress yesterday that Iran has been ""funding and encouraging"" protest activity in the US. During his speech, Mr Netanyahu labelled protesters as ""Iran's useful idiots"". Israelis didn't hear anything in Benjamin Netanyahu's address to Congress that they wanted to hear, says a former senior policy adviser to the state department. Mr Netanyahu spoke for more than an hour in Washington as he seeks to drum up support for the ongoing war in Gaza. The visit is seen as a political risk for the US and the protests both inside and outside the Capitol yesterday testified to that. Speaking to Sky News today, Laura Blumenfeld said Mr Netanyahu's speech didn't go down well in his home country. ""There's a real difference between his soaring rhetoric yesterday and the grim stats and the reality back home in Israel,"" said Ms Blumnefeld, who was formerly a senior policy adviser for Israel-Palestine negotiations. ""Israelis were disappointed by this speech. They say it was a speech for an American audience because they didn't hear the one thing they wanted to hear, which is him accepting responsibility for the 7 October attacks.""  "
Connor Barwin,Welcome to Trieste: Former NFL star buys into Italian basketball club with starstruck history,https://theathletic.com/4680711/2023/07/17/connor-barwin-trieste-basketball-eagles/,"NFL In 1985, as part of a Nike-sponsored trip to Europe, Michael Jordan ended up in the seaside Italian city of Trieste. Jordan played in an exhibition game for local club Pallacanestro Trieste, wearing its jersey when he mimicked his signature logo during a fast break and dunked with such force that he shattered the backboard. The Jordan brand released the “Shattered Backboard” Air Jordan 1 in 2015 to honor the event, which has become part of Trieste lore. Advertisement The visit helped strengthen an appreciation for basketball in a city where American troops were stationed following World War II, and that engrained basketball culture was one of the appeals for former NFL pass rusher Connor Barwin and five classmates from the University of Pennsylvania’s Wharton School MBA program for executives — aka the Cotogna Sports Group — who purchased a 90 percent stake in the club for $5 million in January. In the team’s home stadium, fans still wear the jersey Jordan wore in 1985 as they bang drums, wave flags and sing from the opening whistle. “You walk down the street, people are wearing red and white,” said Fitzann Reid, a co-owner and finance lawyer. “If a team loses a regular-season game, grown men are crying. It’s such a passion for basketball that I didn’t know existed outside of the U.S.” They are the first American owners in Italian basketball since Kobe Bryant was an investor in a group that purchased Olimpia Milano in 1999. And if this is the basketball version of “Welcome to Wrexham,” Barwin is the most recognizable face. GO DEEPER Wrexham's Hollywood promotion: How Reynolds and McElhenney helped end 15 years of hurt He played four years in Philadelphia and was one of the market’s most popular athletes. He lived in Center City and rode public transit, biked to work and became a staple in the community. Parks are cleaner, playgrounds are safer and musical tastes are refined because of Barwin’s work. He’s been asked before when is he running for mayor. The Eagles had a job waiting for him soon after he retired from the NFL in 2019, and he has been a member of the front office ever since. Now the director of player development, he went to Wharton on the side. The group first looked at soccer, but a professor gave them a lead on Trieste, two hours from Venice and near the borders of basketball hotbeds Slovenia and Croatia — NBA star Luka Doncic grew up about one hour away. The new owners’ thesis, according to Barwin, was that “European basketball is probably close to where European football was 20 years ago.” Advertisement “The fans have been there a long time, and there’s a rich history of this team,” he said. “And if anybody asked me why this team, it’s 100 percent because of the fan base and how much they love this basketball team.” Before his NFL career, which included a Pro Bowl berth and second-team All-Pro honors with the Eagles in 2014, Barwin played college basketball in the Big East when the conference produced eight NCAA Tournament bids during a year when it was an eight-bid conference. He has preserved relationships in basketball that now stretch into the college and professional ranks, which he thinks he can leverage to the team’s advantage, along with his NFL connections, but he’s more than just the jock of the group. “He’s developed really strong instincts and a really solid knowledge base of what good business looks like,” said Richard De Meo, another co-owner and current president of the Trieste team who serves as CEO of the Foenix Partners brokerage firm in London. “He definitely brings that kind of sprinkling of stardust to conversations with his name and with his NFL associations, sure, without a doubt. But he’s a contributor in terms of good business instincts.” Barwin spent three months leading an exhaustive search for a general manager before hiring Michael Arcieri last month. Arcieri worked for four NBA franchises before becoming the general manager at Varese and winning the Italian top league’s equivalent of the executive of the year award. Barwin considers hiring the general manager and the coach as the most important responsibilities for an owner, and he utilized the philosophies he learned while working in the Eagles’ front office during the search. Last Tuesday, Trieste hired Jamion Christian, the former George Washington, Siena and Mount St. Mary’s head coach, to lead the team this season. There has been a stigma at times against American ownership in Europe. Eight Premier League soccer clubs have North American owners, as do six of Italy’s top 20 clubs, per the Associated Press. Every sport, league and club offers its own nuances, but after spending autumn Sundays in Philadelphia, Barwin found it easy to draw a simple conclusion about sports ownership: You’re a steward of the franchise. It’s not your team — it’s the fans’ team. Advertisement “I think playing in Philadelphia might have been the best thing to prepare me for this opportunity,” said Barwin, who grew up in Detroit as the son of a city manager. “You realize how connected you are with the fan base and the community, and you understand your role and you really understand this magical thing only works when you all sort of work together and complement each other. “I can’t speak to any other American who’s invested in European soccer or basketball, but I think if you ever go into it thinking this is a great business opportunity and it’s all going to be done on spreadsheets and you’re just gonna hire somebody to go over there being an operator, it’s really hard to be successful.” De Meo speaks Italian and has lived and worked in the country, and while the group has American sporting culture sensibilities, he said there’s a priority to be culturally sensitive — there won’t be a halftime show competing with the fans’ synchronized singing without consultation. “We didn’t want to be the American owners that come in … and knew better and started to implement changes without understanding first what they’ve done in the past,” De Meo said. What Barwin has learned in six months is how different Italian basketball is from what he follows in the NBA. A 40-minute game once a week in the Italian league brings comparisons to the NFL. There’s an investment and a meaning that might not be present in February in Detroit on the second day of an NBA team’s back-to-back. Barwin watches games in the basement of his Philadelphia home with his wife, Laura, and two children, and wants to find a way to make it easier for American basketball fans to view their games. He has seen firsthand how media rights and streaming possibilities are revenue opportunities, and he believes Trieste offers a product that like-minded Americans can enjoy. “It’s so f—ing entertaining,” Barwin said. “We play 30 games. We play once a week. It’s 40 minutes. And there’s promotion/relegation. So everything matters and the players can feel that the fans feel it. It’s a roller coaster ride of the season. And these are some of the best players in the world. I mean, there’s only so many people that can play in the NBA.” He would know. Find footage of former Ohio State star Greg Oden — the 2007 No. 1 NBA Draft pick — playing a much-anticipated game in his hometown of Indianapolis against Cincinnati on Dec. 16, 2006. You’ll see stretches where the Bearcats assign the 7-foot center to a shaggy-haired, 6-foot-4 guy who looks like a football player. Advertisement It’s common to hear players explain how other sports were their first love. It’s less common to see how deep the relationship went. Barwin played two seasons of college basketball for the Bearcats after walking on, starting 11 games in 2005-06 for a 21-win team. But he showed more promise in football, where he moved from tight end to defensive end and became a second-round pick in 2009. Had he stuck with basketball, it’s conceivable he could have played professionally overseas. That connection made him even more interested in the opportunity with Trieste. “If you’d asked me when I was 14 what I want to do, it was definitely be a professional basketball player, not a football player,” Barwin said. “I was just better at football. I think basketball players are the greatest athletes in the world. It’s really hard to play in the NBA, and there are a lot of great players that are playing around the world.” The Lega Basket Serie A (LBA, Italy’s first division) has restrictions on the number of non-Italian players on a roster, and those restrictions are even tighter in a lower division like Serie A2, where Trieste finds itself after being relegated months after the purchase by the Wharton group. Barwin says they see rules as opportunities. The academy system is different than in American basketball, allowing for a pipeline. There are good players in Italy, and the ownership group wants to become a destination for Americans playing overseas. “If I would have known that there was this opportunity over in Europe …” Barwin said. “Italy is not a bad place to go play. Trieste is a beautiful city to go live in if you’re an American, for eight months out of the year.” The new owners want to incorporate data analytics, and the Wharton network has already been a resource. De Meo mentioned opportunities with artificial intelligence. There are also strides that can be made in player wellness and mental health, where Memphis Grizzlies team cardiologist John Jefferies — another one of the new owners — may be able to use his expertise and connections. Advertisement The club was not purchased as a flip. The ownership group is operating with a long runway, which is why the threat of relegation, which occurred after it bought the club but before it could make many material changes, was viewed as more of an obstacle than a deterrent. The goal is to earn promotion back to Serie A, then compete to play in the EuroLeague. The business and operations are undergoing modernization. They’re seeking non-basketball stadium events. Barwin hopes there eventually will be a new arena. And that the club can become a pipeline. Then, the Wharton group hopes to replicate the Trieste model by investing in other sports franchises. When Barwin first joined the Eagles’ front office in 2020, his title was “special assistant to the general manager.” He has seen how many talented people work for sports franchises but had limited impact on decision-making. Part of building what Barwin termed a “modern basketball operation” is creating an environment where talented executives and coaches innovate. If they do well, they can continue to rise up the basketball food chain. “I’m hoping we become a place where coaches can go and you can win and you can develop players,” Barwin said. “And if you can galvanize a community and a team and do it all in Italy, you can definitely go do it in the NBA.” Barwin’s not particularly good at retirement. He followed a 10-year career by almost immediately joining the Eagles’ front office; there are more exotic vacations to take after a decade of wrestling offensive tackles than a week at the Senior Bowl in Mobile, Ala. His travels to Italy bring him to a crowded arena of screaming members of Curva Nord, the passionate fan group that supports Trieste — not a yacht on the Amalfi Coast. “I knew that playing was going to end and I wanted to stay involved,” Barwin said. “I didn’t know exactly how — and I still don’t know exactly how — but I love sports, I love the way it brings people together, I love the people that I’ve gotten to know and work with. And I don’t think there’s many things out there that sort of bring people together and make you feel the emotions that sports do.” Advertisement Barwin wants to retire the term “retire” from professional athletes. He tells players as much in his day job. “They’re not retiring. They’re just done playing,” Barwin said. “And for me, I’ve always thought of it that way. I was done playing football after the 2018 season. That’s it.” He’s busier — and he makes less money — but he’s stimulated by the work. He meets with his ownership group at least once a week. If an American player is homesick or needs help adjusting to the culture, Barwin is on the phone with them. He chats with agents, confers with coaches and works with the front office. The versatility that stretches from the locker room to the board room — and even the bleachers — makes Barwin particularly valuable to the operation. And it’s valuable for him, too. Barwin returns to the Eagles’ offices with better insight into how to do his day job. “It’s not work when you sort of love what you’re doing and you’re excited about it,” Barwin said. “I want to be on the phone talking to people about this. And learning about Italian basketball and learning about well-run NBA organizations. I think all of this is only going to help me be better at my job here with the Eagles and whatever I do in the future.” That’s what’s fascinating about Barwin’s non-retirement retirement. He spent one part of his day working for a general manager and another part hiring one. If only 22-year-old Michael Jordan could put on a Trieste jersey again.

Ryan Reynolds and Hugh Jackman discuss Marvel on YouTube. Oscar-winning producer Jon Landau, known for Titanic and Avatar, passes away. Latest Hollywood News Today Transcript at 7:30 PM on 8 July 2024 Let's begin with our top story: Here is a mini-review of Despicable Me 4: The film is driven solely by the purpose of cashing in, with a plot that is as inconsequential and as scattered as the minions swarming around, and with none of the laughs and little of the warmth. This is despite adding yet another member to the family of Gru (Carell), this time a baby. Meanwhile, Lucy and the girls are battling their own transition, and their mean neighbour’s daughter called Poppy (King), who proclaims that it’s not that she doesn’t respect elders… “I don’t respect Boomers”. Indian Express rated the film 1 out of 5 stars.   Actors Ryan Reynolds and Hugh Jackman recently sat down for a conversation with the Indian chapter of Marvel’s YouTube channel. Jackman, a keen cricket fan described by Reynolds as “obsessed” with the sport, was asked about his favourite Indian cricketer. Without hesitation, Jackman named Rohit Sharma. Meanwhile, Ryan Reynolds was asked which Bollywood actor he would like to work with. After a moment’s thought, he said, “Ranveer Singh is amazing. He has done the voice of Deadpool (in Hindi). He is also very funny... You think you are in shape? This guy makes you look like a crypt-keeper."" The film Deadpool & Wolverine directed by Shawn Levy is set to hit the screens worldwide on July 26.   In some tragic news: Jon Landau, an Oscar-winning producer who worked closely with director James Cameron on three of the biggest blockbusters of all time, Titanic and two Avatar films, has died. Landau’s family announced his death on Saturday, 6th July. Landau’s partnership with Cameron led to three Oscar nominations and a best picture win for 1997’s Titanic. Together the pair account for some of the biggest blockbusters in movie history, including Avatar and its sequel, Avatar: The Way of Water.” In a statement, Cameron said, “A part of myself has been torn away... His legacy is not just the films he produced, but the personal example he set — indomitable, caring, inclusive, and tireless.”   Here is a mini-review of Beverly Hills Cop: Axel F: An approximation of ‘80s action-comedies but with an eye on contemporary anxieties, this movie is an uneven experience that doesn’t make you want to hurl an Adidas shoe at your screen as some other recent Netflix movies might have but also doesn’t leave much of an impression. The movie finds Murphy’s titular troublemaker answering a call to home and confronting his past. As always, it’s the emotional undercurrent that grounds Axel’s increasingly outlandish escapades. Directed by debutante Mark Malloy, Beverly Hills Cop: Axel F doesn’t have the retro energy of the new Bad Boys films. Indian Express rated the movie 3 out of 5 stars.   Next up: Filmmaker Mira Nair and actor Shabana Azmi spoke about the importance of an actor remaining connected to common people, and how difficult this can become as they become famous. Mira said in an interview at the New York Indian Film Festival alongside Shabana Azmi: “Tom Cruise has in his contract that you cannot meet his eyes. You’re not allowed to look at him in the eyes.” Shabana appeared to be taken aback by this revelation. Mira continued to claim it was true but also seemed to be cautious about what she was revealing. Cruise is known to be a demanding presence on film sets.   Chris Pratt visited his Guardians of the Galaxy director and new DCU co-head James Gunn on the set of the upcoming movie Superman. In an Interview with TMZ, Pratt said, “If it could fit into my schedule and it made sense, I would love it. Of course, I love playing Star-Lord, and hopefully, there’s a chance that can come back. I feel so blessed to be able to do any of it, to be considered for any of it. If it’s right and the fans would love it, I’d be more than happy to do.” Earlier this month, the 45-year-old visited the sets of Gunn’s directorial Superman and the filmmaker shared their picture on social media.   Meanwhile: Pictures from the set of Superman have gone viral on social media, revealing the look of David Corenswet as the Last son of Krypton. The actor is seen wearing the classic costume that’s heavily inspired by the comics. He is seen in the iconic red-and-blue costume with the cape, which is more vibrant and unlike the costumes seen in Zack Snyder’s Superman. Fans of the superhero franchise are on cloud nine and claim that David Corenset is the perfect fit to play the character. Along with David Corenswet, Edi Gathegi was also clicked. Edi, who is playing Mister Terrific in the upcoming film, was also seen in a costume that justifies the ones in the comics.   From the Tony Awards: Stereophonic, the play about a Fleetwood Mac-like band recording an album over a turbulent and life-changing year, got a lighters-in-the-air cheer at the Tony Awards on Sunday, June 16 winning best new play while theatre history was made for women as Broadway directors and score writers. Stereophonic, the most-nominated play in Tony Awards history, is a hyper-naturalistic meditation on the thrill and danger of collaborating on art — the compromises, the egos, and the joys. It was written by David Adjmi with songs by former Arcade Fire member Will Butler. Danya Taymor became the 11th woman to win the award.   Lastly: Daniel Radcliffe took home his first Tony Award for the Broadway musical Merrily We Roll Along and the 34-year-old couldn’t stop being emotional. Radcliffe won the award for Featured Actor in a Musical for his portrayal of Charley Kringas in Merrily We Roll Along. Daniel said while accepting the award: “I’m going to talk fast and try not to cry."" Daniel Radcliffe also gave a shout-out to his co-stars Jonathan Groff, and Lindsay Mendez, whom he will miss working with. This Tony Award marks Radcliffe’s first win and nomination for his performance in a Broadway production."
Ryan Giggs,'He had the dream debut' - Manchester United wonderkid who scored two goals tipped for stardom,https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/uk-sport-news/manchester-united-giggs-wilson-northampton-29465425,"Sign up for our daily newsletter to get the day's biggest stories sent direct to your inbox We have more newsletters Sign up for our daily newsletter to get the day's biggest stories sent direct to your inbox We have more newsletters Former Manchester United prodigy James Wilson has been snapped up by Northampton Town following his release from Port Vale. Red Devils icon Ryan Giggs was serving as interim player-manager at United when he tipped Wilson for a bright future following a brace on his senior debut. Giggs saw potential in the young Wilson and decided to give him a start in their penultimate Premier League match of the 2013/14 season against Hull City. Wilson returned the favour by bagging two goals as United triumphed 3-1 over the Tigers, marking himself out as a rising star for the future. However, the English striker never quite lived up to the promise his debut suggested. READ MORE: Mason Mount breaks Man United silence with three-word promise after announcement READ MORE: ‘I wasn’t enjoying it’ - Manchester United star must decide his own future amid transfer rumours He featured infrequently for United over the subsequent four years before leaving permanently for Aberdeen in 2019. It was only six months later that he returned to England with Salford City, spending a season-and-a-half at Moor Lane before moving to Port Vale. Wilson was among the players the club released following their relegation to League Two at the end of last season. However, the forward will remain in England's second tier. The former wonderkid didn't have to wait long to find a new club as Northampton announced his signature. Now serving as director of football at Wilson's old club, Salford, Giggs reminisced about the time he gave the youngster his first start and lauded the qualities the striker initially showcased at Old Trafford. ""I remember we'd been beaten and I wanted to throw in some young players,"" said the United legend. ""James came across, he trained really well. I already knew about him because he was a goalscorer, he was scoring regularly for both the reserves and the youth team. United's Adidas home shirt is made up of the same colour of the city's iconic red rose and features a black collar. The collar also features a dash of both red and white, giving it a slick and modernised look. Prices start from £55 ""He really impressed me with the way he trained and the way he had an eye for a goal, and he had the dream debut, didn't he? He scored a couple of goals. He's always been a really good finisher. He had his injury problems, but he's a good lad. He always wanted to improve."" Now on his third team in four years, the 28-year-old hasn't wholly reached the potential he first displayed with the Red Devils. However, he now has a new opportunity to impress in League One with the Cobblers, hoping to reach the same heights that saw him bag a career-high 15 goals in his debut campaign at Port Vale.

Michael Robinson,"Collecting the cards of ‘The Jackie Robinson’ of the other major sports: Earl Lloyd, Kenny Washington and more",https://theathletic.com/4979290/2023/11/04/jackie-robinson-trading-card-value-earl-lloyd/,"Jackie Robinson is on the Mount Rushmore of the vintage card hobby. And it’s easy to see why — he was a great player and his societal impact in the United States transcended his sport when he broke through segregation in baseball in 1947. Lately, in the past five years, his cards have been strongly appreciating. Robinson’s 1954 Topps card is up 348% in a PSA 5 (excellent condition). His rookie card (1948 Leaf) is up 414%. His 1953 Topps is up 700%. So let’s call it about a 500% return across the spectrum, using auction prices via the PSA website, the most conservative way to value cards. Advertisement Vintage cards of other Black sports pioneers in the major U.S. men’s leagues are also going up in value, as well as for one of the most prominent Black athletes ever, the boxing pioneer Jack Johnson. Here’s a look at how the hobby has considered cards depicting some of the biggest figures of racial progress in American culture, and our assessment of the markets. Let’s focus on the top leagues first and save Johnson for last. Bobby Marshall and Fritz Pollard are widely credited as the first two Black players to compete in the NFL when they debuted in 1920. But professional football was well behind baseball and boxing in terms of its popularity then, and there are no vintage cards for them.  Leading into the 1946 season, at least four Black players were signed by NFL teams, but not all were issued vintage cards. Kenny Washington (who played baseball at UCLA with Robinson) and Woody Strode signed with the Rams, and Marion Motley and Bill Willis signed with the Browns, which were in a rival league that was absorbed by the NFL. Willis was not issued a vintage card, and neither was Strode, who became a movie star with appearances in “Spartacus” and perhaps most famously in the opening to “Once Upon a Time in the West.” So let’s start with Washington, who has a 1948 Bowman rookie card (black and white). These prices are up 500% (to $250) since 2018 in PSA 5 (EX condition). Note the last sale of a 5 was 2021 but a PSA 4 sold recently for $256, though it’s very well centered and thus more valuable than the technical grade. Washington also has a 1948 Leaf card (faux color) that qualifies as a rookie card, and those are up 900% in the more common black name variety; they can be had for about $350 in a nice PSA 4. I’d wait on more sales for this one before going close to 900%, which seems too high, frankly. Advertisement Motley is a Hall of Famer, a three-time rushing champion who averaged 5.7 yards per carry and 13.0 yards per catch. He revolutionized the running back position to one of size and power as well as speed. His rookie card is a 1950 Bowman and very tough to find centered. You can get a PSA 5 now for about $500 and that’s up 400% since 2018. I think this card is a strong buy still. The last PSA 3, a very recent sale, sold for about 400% over 2018 prices. I think a PSA 5 1950 Motley, centered, is a legit $650 card in the foreseeable future. (Football is also way more rare than baseball in that era.) Among the first Black players to sign with the NBA was Sweetwater Clifton, who was nicknamed Nat and came into the league in 1950; the same year as Earl Lloyd and Chuck Cooper (another player, Harold Hunter, was drafted and signed a contract in 1950 but was cut before the season). Clifton signed with the Knicks in 1950 from the Harlem Globetrotters, and his rookie card is the 1957 Topps. This set is notoriously beset with centering and print issues. It’s also extremely rare and thus hard to price given the lack of sales in any grade. I have a way to calculate this more broadly using prices across any grade and I’m getting about 400% appreciation over five years. A centered 5 with overall eye appeal is about  $475. Clifton is in the Hall of Fame. The card is well photographed, too. I have it on my personal “buy” list. Lloyd, who also has a card in the 1957 set, was the first of the trio to play a regular season NBA game. I bought this PSA 3 this month for $124 in an auction. I only have data for the card since 2021 but it is down about 60%. That makes no sense. Lloyd is in the Hall of Fame and was a solid player. I think this card is the biggest value in the hobby now. It should be up 300%, minimum. So even if this was just a $100 card in 2018 (I can’t find prices going back that far), that would be $300 now. Cooper does not have a card. Advertisement Neither does Willie O’Ree, the first Black player in the NHL, who was from Canada and played for 20 years, though scantly. In boxing, Johnson, is widely known as the first Black world heavyweight champion and really the first Black sports celebrity (and target of virulent racism for demolishing white boxers and dating white women). At my first show after getting back into the hobby in 2016, the 1910 Jack Johnson (side face) in a centered PSA 3.5 was the first card I bought, for $90. I figured it had to be a steal. When I got home and looked it up, they were selling for $60. I felt like a had $30 stolen from me. That was a 50% loss. But, subjectively, that price made no sense to me. How could a figure as iconic in a well-conditioned card from 1910 have a card of such little value? Fast forward to today: The card is worth about $350 in that condition — and one I would recommend buying at that price still. So even at what seemed like a high price at the time, it’s nearly a 400% return (600% at market price in 2016). It’s never timing the market at the right price. Rather, you need to buy the right cards that are likely to retain demand that’s higher than the supply. All my horrible buys when I started are great buys today because I bought the right cards — iconic Hall of Famers, rookies, figures like Johnson.

Justin Forsett,EXCLUSIVE: NFL Legend Justin Forsett Explains How Stephen Curry and 50 Cent Followed Michael Jordan’s Billionaire Path,https://www.essentiallysports.com/nfl-ncaa-news-nba-legends-basketball-news-es-think-tank-exclusive-nfl-legend-justin-forsett-explains-how-stephen-curry-and-fifty-cent-followed-michael-jordans-billionaire-path/,"More Sports ES Fancast Aug 7, 2024 | 6:12 AM EDT via Imago Image Credits: Marcus Eriksson / AP via Imago Image Credits: Marcus Eriksson / AP The intersection of sports and commerce has evolved from a purely professional relationship to a strategic partnership, and at the epicenter of this transformation stands the iconic alliance between Michael Jordan and Nike. This symbiotic relationship, as former NFL star and astute entrepreneur Justin Forsett elucidates, has laid the groundwork for a new era of athlete-brand collaborations. After all, in a world where athlete endorsements often feel transactional, a genuine collaboration that transcends the commercial realm is a rare gem. Forsett, whose entrepreneurial journey post-football has seen him scale heights with Hustle Clean in a growth curve mirroring the tenacity of his football career, offers a unique perspective on the dynamics of athlete-brand partnerships. In today’s episode of EssentiallySports Think Tank, he delved deep into the intricacies of the Jordan-Nike collaboration with our host and brand innovator extraordinaire, Trey Holder, unraveling the secrets of its enduring success. His admiration for the globally acclaimed partnership is not just a fanboy moment; it’s an insider’s insight into a business model that has, quite literally, reshaped the sports marketing landscape. ADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad “For me, every time I bring on somebody within our team, on the business side, I tell them, if, like, you know, interested in the business world, you’re interested in entrepreneurship, I tell them to reshoot off. I’m a big fan of Nike. I love the brand. I love the story and how they were created, the hurdles that they had to overcome. I love all of the partnerships—at least most of the partnerships—that they’ve been able to create. But it’s really hard to be the (Michael) Jordan partnership in a number of ways, because it was just a perfect fit,” Forsett emphasizes. Poll 1 of 4  Who do you think has had the most significant impact on sports business? Michael Jordan Stephen Curry Fifty Cent Justin Forsett Do you think Ice Cube's $150,000 challenge to the 3x3 Olympics gold medalist is fair? Absolutely No way It's just for show Depends on the players Do you think Nikola Jokic will dominate the Paris Olympics? Absolutely No way Maybe Too early to tell Who do you think will dominate the ROTY rivalry? Angel Reese Caitlin Clark Both will shine Neither will stand out The former NFL-Pro’s analysis is a masterclass in understanding the symbiotic relationship between an athlete and a brand. “That fit and that partnership, now that one shoe, that one deal has really birthed a model for athletes on how we can really leverage our identity on and off the field or on and off the court,” he asserts. The Jordan-Nike collaboration was more than just a shoe deal; it was a blueprint that set the path forward for thousands of others to follow. Forsett emphasizes the importance of equity in these partnerships, a concept that was revolutionary in its time. “It’s not only great. The brand is awesome. The storytelling of, like, the commercials, the whole, if we go back and just like, study the 80s and 90s, when Nike was shooting those commercials. It’s like this aspirational piece, like everybody felt like they could be this Michael Jordan of whatever profession or career that they were in, because it was driving home or tapping into this emotion of just high aspiration, inspiration that really fueled a lot of people, a lot of, you know, goal-oriented people, that it just resonated in a real way.” Moreover, the Jordan-Nike collaboration transcended the realm of sports to become a cultural phenomenon. The brand’s ability to tap into the collective psyche and create an aspirational image stands further evidence of its marketing prowess. The synergy between Michael Jordan and Nike was a confluence of factors: an exceptional athlete, a forward-thinking brand, and a shared vision. This alignment, Forsett argues, is the cornerstone of any successful athlete-brand partnership. “They were betting on an athlete. Even though they thought he was going to be a really good player, they didn’t think he was going to be, you know, maybe the greatest of all-time player.” This aspirational element, Forsett contends, is the secret sauce that has propelled countless athletes to stardom. By creating an aspirational figure, brands not only sell products but also inspire a generation. “We don’t have to just look at the instant money right now when it comes to a deal, like, is there an opportunity for an equity piece for the athlete or the influencer that now we see? There’s tons of guys out there… whether it’s Steph Curry and Under Armor—that has some equity in it. I mean, you saw the 50 Cents and Vitamin Waters…  like it all stemmed, I believe, from that Michael Jordan concept. And I think it was Charles Barkley telling the story about how he structured his deal based on how Michael Jordan was so successful with his deal with Nike. So it’s just really, I feel like a historic, traditional partnership that everyone should love and study,” Forsett observes in the Exclusive EssentiallySports interview with host Trey Holder.

Rob Kligman ADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad The ability to secure equity in a brand is a game-changer for athletes, allowing them to diversify their income streams and build long-term wealth. The impact of this strategy is evident in the careers of athletes and celebrities like Stephen Curry, 50 Cents, and even LeBron James, who have successfully leveraged their platforms to build personal brands in collaboration with business moguls like Nike. Today, the landscape has evolved. Athletes are increasingly becoming entrepreneurs, building their own brands, and seeking equity stakes in their partnerships. Justin Forsett’s insights into this shift are invaluable for brands looking to forge meaningful connections with athletes. The Jordan Brand itself is a financial powerhouse, raking in billions annually. Recent figures reveal it generated a staggering $6.59 billion in revenue, accounting for a substantial 13% of Nike’s total fiscal year 2023 sales, which reached $50.6 billion. Jordan’s personal earnings from this partnership are estimated to surpass $1.5 billion, cementing his position as one of history’s wealthiest athletes. This financial prowess raises a critical question: How can other brands replicate the Jordan-Nike model to create similarly impactful and lucrative partnerships? By examining the intricacies of this iconic collaboration, businesses can unlock the potential for exponential growth through strategic athlete alliances. Find that out in this week’s episode of EssentiallySports Think Tank, where Justin Forsett delves deeper into these questions with our host, Trey Holder, also sharing his experience of how athletes of the 21st century can leverage initiatives like NIL by creating a brand based on nothing but their own selves.

Amir Johnson,"Former Celtic Amir Johnson isn’t playing in the NBA now, but his contributions are notable",https://www.bostonglobe.com/2022/03/19/sports/former-celtic-amir-johnson-isnt-playing-nba-now-his-contributions-are-notable/,"It’s been three years since Amir Johnson donned an NBA uniform, yet his contributions to the league remain relevant and strong. The 34-year-old longtime NBA veteran signed with the G League Ignite club, a group of NBA prospects, many of whom are on $500,000 contracts following high school, as a means to prepare for the draft. NBA lottery picks Jalen Green (Rockets) and Jonathan Kuminga (Warriors) were drafted after one season with the Ignite  with Johnson as their mentor. Johnson wants to serve as the old head on the Ignite, the veteran presence who can teach aspiring NBA players how to be a professional. Nearly two decades ago, Johnson entered the draft out of Westchester (Los Angeles) High School, the final prep-to-pros class. He played 12 seasons and parts of two others with the  Pistons, Raptors, Celtics and 76ers, and he found playing with the Ignite as a means to remain in the game and pass along his knowledge. The Ignite played against the Cleveland Charge during All-Star Weekend, and Johnson and his teammates played at Cleveland State just hours before the All-Star Game, giving the young guys exposure to the All-Star atmosphere as they begin their trek to the highest level. Advertisement “Times like this you have to just experience it because you might not get to come here anymore,” Johnson told the Globe. “I tell the youngins, to take it all in. This is the highest level of basketball and you get to see it and it’s dope and I’m happy for them.” Johnson knows he may never get back to the NBA, but he wanted to teach and still  has the skills to play. He averaged 8.5 points and 3.3 rebounds as a backup center for the Ignite, but he’s an asset to the coaching staff because of his vast experience and knowledge, especially of defense. “It’s perfect for me to be here because I was in the same position as these guys,” he said. “I just have a lot of say-so, just from experience, for me to be here with these young guys coming out of high school at 18 and they get to come here first to get some learning experience and then go. It’s amazing because when I went, everybody in the NBA was like 30 and up. Now you get some vets on this team and they get to learn and then go in the fire.” Advertisement Johnson, who last played for the 76ers in 2019, didn’t want to just go home and chill with his kids. He’s only 34. He was in the unusual position of being too young to give up the game but not  a real consideration for an NBA contract. The G-League was the ideal landing spot. “It was just a no-brainer for me to be here,” he said. “It’s good seeing guys like Jalen [Green] and Jonathan Kuminga thrive and play at the next level. Just can’t wait for the next guys to be up and see what they can do.” But why? The G-League isn’t glamourous. Many games are in smaller arenas with no fanfare. It’s mainly  a training ground for prospects. Many players who are advanced in their careers play there for the adoration of the game, with little chance of even a 10-day NBA contract. “Maybe I have another calling for coaching but I love the game and want to be around it,” he said. “I still have that itch to go out there and hoop. And I feel like I can talk to guys more when I’m actually on the court and playing. I asked Scoot [Henderson] is it easier when I’m on the court talking to you on defense? He was like, ‘yes.’ ” Johnson, who played two seasons with the Celtics and was a member of the Eastern Conference finals team in 2017, was a defensive stalwart, screen-setter, and rebounder. He refined a skill set that made  him a valuable commodity in the league for years. Advertisement “There’s certain stuff I know playing the game,” he said. “I tell them I’ve been in the league 15 years, made close to $100 million and I averaged 6 points in the NBA. Even if they don’t know my career, I tell them I wasn’t a superstar but I always did the little things.  What make teams win games are the little things. If you can make someone else better on that team, that makes a great teammate and I totally agree with them. “[The  Thunder] has Nick Collison’s jersey retired and he wasn’t a Top 50 guy. He was just a solid dude that set screens, good person around the community. Guys like that can last  a long way in the league. You just have to find that niche and find what works. “When you’re on a team like Golden State, you’re going to have to learn how to play defense, how to gel with a team. I think they are learning, it just takes repetition.” Johnson said he is telling the prospects, such as Henderson, Jaden Hardy and Michael Foster Jr. about life off the floor. The NBA life is not easy. There is sudden wealth, family pressure, the night life. “Take your mind off getting paid, getting minutes. Go have fun, go play basketball and go learn,” he said he tells his young teammates. “Listen to what people have to say that’s been doing it. Once that carries on, it doesn’t matter if one person or 50,000 people are in the crowd. You’re going to focus on the task at hand, which is play basketball and play the right way.” Advertisement Johnson earned $35 million in the final three full seasons of his NBA career. He said he allowed his mother to handle his financial affairs when he came into the league at 18. But he’s urging his Ignite teammates to take more control of their finances, take more responsibility for their livelihood instead of just being ballers. There are too many cases of NBA players blowing their money or losing their riches because of frivolous spending or failed investments. Johnson said adulthood begins for these prospects the moment they  became professionals. “I tell these guys when they’re dealing with family, show you’re family that you’re a man now,” he said. “Speak up and say your opinion, and tell them what’s on your mind. Let them know, communicate what’s going on. “There’s a lot that comes with this life. You want to know everybody’s that’s working for you, their name, how much you’re paying them. I always ask them, who’s your agent? How much you paying them? I didn’t know at first. I had to learn the business side because at first I let my mom do it. You want to jump into that early because you know what’s going on. Eventually your mom is going to have to get out of your business and you’re going to have to handle it yourself. Ask questions. Check your money because some of the top players you love been [taken advantage of].” Johnson’s chances of an NBA return are  miniscule. When teams were allowed to sign players to 10-day hardship contracts because of COVID-19, several G-League veterans got calls. Johnson didn’t. Advertisement “If it comes around I definitely wouldn’t mind,” he said. “If a team needs my services, I  certainly know what to do to help a team out. I certainly wouldn’t come and mess up what an organization’s got going. I would blend right in because I know what to do with certain teams on the come up. That’s been the story of my career, going to Toronto, starting up when [Chris Bosh] left and to Boston when the Big Three left, trying to get to the playoffs. I know how to be a good teammate.” Johnson said he has aspirations to coach, and he has received just as much knowledge from the experience as he has given. “I’m learning a lot about the coaching part,” he said. “I’m learning to use my knowledge I have to teach guys certain stuff. I teach them how to play basketball, move the ball and set screens, just certain things that I’ve done and tricks I learned from  [Rasheed Wallace]. A lot of the stuff we learned from the vets and I just pass it on.” Still, the travel takes Johnson away from his family. He could be home living comfortably and being retired. Instead, he’s grinding against Santa Cruz and Sioux Falls. But he loves that life. “The family wants me home, I ain’t going to  lie to you but they have an understanding,” he said. “They know I have a passion for it. Family, we’re always going to figure it out. They’re always going to have my best intentions and my back. “I’m  going to play until I can’t go no more. It keeps me in shape. It keeps me busy. Keeps me involved. I don’t want to just disappear and then what happened to Amir? But I want to stay in the groove so people know I love the game and I want to learn a different side. Seeing these guys get drafted is like a championship to me. I got to experience playing with them. That’s my championship right there.” Jaylen Brown remains a sneaker free agent, which is a big deal in today’s NBA circles. Brown’s deal with Adidas expired in 2021 and he has been rocking several types of shoes in games this season. Brown is taking the decision seriously, as he does with every other career decision. The enjoyable part for Brown is choosing which shoe to wear for each game. One day it could be Nikes, then New Balances, then perhaps Under Armour or Converse. “Yeah I feel free; I feel free,” Brown said. “I think that’s how things have been over the last, I don’t know how long, you’ve got to rock one brand and stick with it. But it’s a new day and age and me and my whole brand is different. We’re trying to shift the mold of the athlete and the way things are done, so for me, I’m enjoying my freedom right now and we’ll see what happens down the line.” Brown said he has had negotiations with competing shoe companies, but  nothing to his preference. “I’ve had numerous conversations with people and everything kind of tends to be the same,” Brown said. “Fit this athlete in this slot and if it’s not him, then we’ll fit another athlete into that slot. You really don’t get nothing out of it. So for me, I’ve been trying to push for some type of individualism, you know what I mean? “If you want to sign Jaylen, you have to look at what I do off the court as well and try to magnify that platform as well, whether it’s my foundation, whether it’s social activism, charity, whatever. That needs to be included. These brands, they talk but they don’t want to include anything that I want to do off the court. It sounds good but when it really comes down to it, they don’t really care.” Brown has created his own “7uice” Foundation and clothing line, and when asked if he could consider creating his own sneaker, similar to former NBA player Stephon Marbury, he was intrigued. “I keep an open mind,” he said, smiling. “It’s an idea that you think about but right now I’m still in the midst of seeing if somebody cares about what goes on outside of basketball and right now, nobody does. [My own shoe] might be something that’s part of the plan. We’ll see.” Several other shoe companies have approached Brown, a rising talent, about his services. But the decision is not simple. It’s far more than just wearing cool sneakers on a nightly basis or filming commercials. “Over the course of this season, I’ve had some meetings, some talks and my team has went back and forth and discussed and argued,” he said. “It’s been dope because a lot of people, they just see what you do on the court. And then off the court, they don’t understand how that whole world works as well. How hard it is to have a platform that stands for something and at the same time, have endorsements. That’s a conversation that doesn’t exist, They’d rather you just be non-controversial, smile, don’t say anything because it’s safe. “All the athletes that I admire. They’re not that. Muhammad Ali, Jim Brown, Kareem [Abdul-Jabbar]. The greats that I admire were outspoken and stood for something. It’s interesting to see they try to push the athlete to do the opposite.” The Hawks are expected to be without power forward John Collins for the rest of the regular season with a right foot issue and a fractured finger. That means Atlanta will have a more difficult time avoiding the 10th and final playoff spot and having to win two games to get into the main playoff tournament. The Hawks made an improbable run to the Eastern Conference finals last season behind the heroics of Trae Young and a strong, young supporting cast. This first full season under Nate McMillan has not worked out as expected and the Hawks are  going to be part of the play-in session with three weeks left in the regular season. The  Wizards, despite a season-ending injury to Bradley Beal, were in the running for the play-in until a West Coast trip swoon   … Russell Westbrook may not be a Laker next season but he’s going to be on somebody’s payroll with a $47 million option, the final year of that extension he signed with the Oklahoma City Thunder. Westbrook has experienced a miserable season and taken most of the blame for the Lakers’ disappointing season. Westbrook’s offensive numbers aren’t as ghastly as they seem this season. Westbrook’s misses — airballs and balls off the backboard — have been  magnified. And he’s become a liability on offense because of his inability to shoot the 3-pointer. Opposing teams are leaving Westbrook wide open and he is still only a 27.7 percent shooter from beyond the arc. His well-chronicled issues with Patrick Beverley made headlines again this week when Beverley was calling Westbrook “trash” to the Lakers’ sideline while Karl-Anthony Towns rebounded a Westbrook air ball and made a joking gesture as if there was a breeze in the Target Center. The Lakers and Westbrook just  haven’t worked out and they could have moved him back to Houston for John Wall, who hasn’t played this season and has a contract that matches Westbrook, but Los Angeles did not want to relinquish a first-round pick in the deal. The rebuilding Rockets are content to allow Wall’s contract to expire and continue their youth movement. The Lakers are going to have to start winning to earn a spot in the play-in tournament. They entered Friday 2½ games ahead of the  Spurs. Of the Lakers’ final 13 games, nine are on the road and 11 are against teams in playoff contention or fighting for playoff seed.

Cade Cunningham,Should the Pistons Expect Cade Cunningham's Recent Play to Be Sustainable?,https://www.givemesport.com/should-the-pistons-expect-cade-cunninghams-recent-play-to-be-sustainable/,"Your changes have been saved  Email is sent Email has already been sent Please verify your email address. You’ve reached your account maximum for followed topics.                     With the Detroit Pistons now 3-2 in their last five games, the team's young core appears to be turning a corner not just in their ability to win games, but to put their own game together as a group.
                         No player on the team exemplifies that more than Cade Cunningham. Averaging 25.8 points and 8.6 assists per game over his last five games while shooting 39.5 percent from deep, Cunningham has been the Pistons' best player and then some. However, is his recent play sustainable?
                         On the surface of Cunningham's recent play, there's nothing that he's doing during this stretch that's much different than what he's done throughout his NBA career. The three-level scoring, tough shot-making, transition playmaking, and rip-throughs on his way to the rim are staples of his game.
                         However, Cunningham has been more efficient than normal, particularly on shots from beyond the arc. This could be due to Cunningham being more prone to taking what the defense gives him instead of forcing the issue.
                         As a player who idolized LeBron James, this makes sense. One of the more unreasonable criticisms against James is that he would rather make the right play than force the issue.
                         Of course, as the best player and top perimeter scoring talent, the right play may sometimes be to force the issue. Nonetheless, this heady style of play has led to tremendous success for James, and it appears that Cunningham is taking a page out of the 20-time All-Star's book.
                         To that point, far more of Cunningham's 3-point attempts during the last five games have been of the wide open variety (no defender within six feet). On the season, 17.8 percent of his three-point attempts qualified as wide open, of which he made 42.4 percent.
                         But over the last five games, 22.0 percent of his shot attempts have been wide open three-pointers, of which he's made 50.0 percent.
                         Cunningham is also getting three-pointers out of his hands quicker. On the season, 20.0 percent of his attempts from deep come out of his hands within two seconds, and he converts 36.7 percent of those.
                         Over the last five games, 30.5 percent of these attempts have come out of his hands within two seconds, and he's converted 36.0 percent of those. On the season, his three-point efficiency falls to 26.0 percent when he holds the ball for 2–6 seconds (25.0 percent over the last five games).

                         There are two areas in which the question of sustainability looms, though not general efficiency. At least for now.
                         First, Cunningham is shooting 43.8 percent on above the break three-point attempts over the last five games. Yet, he shoots 36.6 percent from that area of the floor over the 55 games that he's played this season.
                         Second, Cunningham has made 40.5 percent of his attempts from 24-feet and out over the last five games. He's been efficient with those long bombs all season, but less so, as he's also shooting 36.6 percent on those attempts over 55 games.
                         Production has never been a question for Cunningham, as he's long been one of the most instinctual scorers and well-rounded basketball players in the country.
                         A player that received his college offer from Oklahoma State as a freshman on the varsity team at Bowie High School, Cunningham is somewhere between a prodigy and a gym rat. In that way, he also resembles James, a player whose natural talent has always been apparent but still worked hard to become even greater.
                         At just 15, his freshman season at Bowie, Cunningham was already becoming a highly touted prospect as the team's second-leading scorer. He went on to earn District 4-6A honors as the Newcomer of the Year.
                         The next year, he earned District 4-6A co-MVP honors after averaging 18.8 points, 8.2 rebounds, and 5.3 assists per game. The year after that, he earned Nike EYBL All-Atlanta MVP honors while playing for the Texas Titans in 2019, averaging 25.1 points, 6.6 rebounds, and 5.2 assists per game.
                         By the time he left Montverde Academy, where he transferred prior to his junior season, he was named 2020 Naismith Prep Player of the Year, 2020 Florida Gatorade Player of the Year, and 2020 Mr. Basketball USA.
                         Cunningham was the top-ranked point guard and ranked second nationally behind eventual Houston Rockets shooting guard Jalen Green.
                         On the international stage, Cunningham was being compared to current Dallas Mavericks star and former EuroLeague sensation Luka Doncic. This was right around the same time that Cunningham was a major reason why Team USA managed a gold medal victory in the 2019 U19 FIBA World Cup.
                         Playing alongside a number of future pros just as he did at powerhouse prep Montverde, Cunningham averaged 11.7 points, 5.7 assists, and 1.4 steals in 23.5 minutes per game.

                         His one-and-done season with the Cowboys would be his magnum opus. After averaging 20.1 points, 6.2 rebounds, 3.5 assists, and 1.6 steals per game while shooting 40.0 percent from 3, he earned several honors.
                         Cunningham's collegiate accolades included: NABC Freshman of the Year, Big 12 Player of the Year, and Consensus All-American (First Team).
                         Cunningham was then selected as the No. 1 pick in the 2021 NBA Draft, one spot ahead of the only player that was ranked ahead of him in the Class of 2020.
                         At 6-foot-6 and 220 pounds, Cunningham is an instinctive scorer with solid athleticism, pronounced court vision, and the ideal intangibles. Showing all the hallmarks of a future All-Star, Cunningham has completely taken over for the Pistons.
                         This makes his selection as the top pick in the 2021 NBA Draft one of the franchise's best decisions in years.
                         More than that, it was their most important draft decision since selecting Andre Drummond with the ninth overall pick in the 2012 NBA Draft. Drummond would spend eight seasons with the Pistons and put up impressive numbers.
                         However, the former franchise cornerstone only reached the NBA Playoffs twice while in Detroit. On top of that, in at least one of those instances, the Pistons were led there by another player.
                         Whether Cunningham will have a similar fate with Detroit is unknown, as his story is yet to be written. All that can be said for now is that he has the keys to take the Pistons across the finish line as they attempt to build their first true championship contender since 2004.
     The Detroit Pistons' rebuild has not gone smoothly, but they possess a young duo who could blossom.

Jonathan Taylor,The Phone Call Jonathan Taylor Thomas And His TV Mom Patricia Richardson Had After Tim Allen Said There Had Been Home Improvement Reboot Discussions,https://www.cinemablend.com/television/phone-call-jonathan-taylor-thomas-patricia-richardson-had-tim-allen-home-improvement-reboot,"Well, this is awkward. 
When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works.
 Hollywood is going through a bit of a reboot/revival/spinoff phase right now, which has seen more than a few beloved TV series make comebacks. One that’s yet to do that is Home Improvement, the Tim Allen-led family sitcom that aired for eight seasons on ABC in the ‘90s. Nevertheless, Allen has been talking about plans to bring back the beloved series for some time now. At one point, he even claimed that the purported production could indeed become a reality and that his former castmates were all up for it. However, fresh comments shared by his on-screen wife, Patricia Richardson, refute that claim. She also opened up about a phone call she had with another co-star, Jonathan Taylor Thomas, after Allen made the claims.   Patricia Richardson played the role of Jillian “Jill” Taylor for the entire duration of HI’s run from 1991 to 1999. As she explained during her recent appearance on the Back to the Best podcast, the work wasn’t always easy due to creative clashes early on or contract negotiations. However, she seems to have a genuine level of affection for the show. That being said, the 73-year-old actress revealed that she was taken aback when Tim Allen – who played Tim Taylor on the sitcom – announced that a reboot of sorts was being considered, with the cast aiming to return. Richardson’s confusion ultimately led her to call her on-screen son, Jonathan Taylor Thomas and, on the podcast, she recalled how that chat played out:  It was so weird. I would hear on Twitter or whatever, I’d hear that he was coming out publicly and saying this stuff about everyone was on board to do a Home Improvement reunion, but he never asked me, and he never asked Jonathan [Taylor Thomas], who I talk to. So I called Jonathan one day, and I said, 'Has he asked you about this? He went, 'No.' ‘So why is he saying everyone is on board when he hasn’t talked to you or me?’ I think that’s weird. If I’m being honest, I would also find it “weird” if I were an actor and a former co-star were talking up a theoretical project and saying I’m involved and in reality, I’m not. I’d imagine that the chat Patricia Richardson and (now-42-year-old) Jonathan Taylor Thomas had was a bit awkward. However, it sounds like the two were of one accord. In a clip from the podcast that was shared to YouTube, Richardson went on to say that Home Improvement’s leading man made a claim about another spinoff, which supposedly involved her character:  And then, there started being this rumor going around that somebody had a script that was like a Jill script, ‘Jill’s Dream,’ or something like that. And [Allen] was kind of lying to people and telling them that I was on board, and I didn’t know anything about it. So I wrote a big thing on Twitter and said, ‘ I'm not involved in any series with Jill and also never even been asked to do another Home Improvement reunion thing.’ But I wouldn’t want to.  The Story Behind Wilson Always Hiding His Face Behind The Fence On Home Improvement We, of course, can’t speak to Tim Allen’s rationale when making such statements, but what can be said is that the 70-year-old comedian has been hyped about bringing the Taylor family back. In 2020, Allen discussed a Home Improvement revival that would theoretically bring back the cast and, at that time, he said that “all the actors think it’s a great idea.” He shared another HI spinoff idea in late 2023, which would focus on the children of Tim and Jill Taylor’s three sons, Mark, Randy and Brad. When discussing a theoretical title, he coined the moniker Home Re-Improvement.  Surely, there are plenty of fans who would love to see what the Tool Time host as well as his friends and family are up to now. However, Patricia Richardson doesn’t think such a series would work for a few reasons:  I mean, Zach[ery Ty Bryan] is now a felon. Taran [Noah Smith] hasn’t acted since he left the show. He's not an actor anymore. And Jonathan's not really interested in acting. He wants to direct and write. And we don’t have Wilson. So if they did it without Earl [Hindman] and also we just have two kids, you know probably, if that, it’s not going to be the show at all. And people think we can just magically go right back to who we were 30 years ago and do a show that was 30 years ago, and we’ve all changed quite a bit, I think. She’s certainly correct in saying that a reboot would look very different from the OG series. On paper, it’s hard to say for sure whether it truly would or wouldn’t work. Regardless, the chances of it actually happening are probably slim, though, especially since Tim Allen is headed back to TV for a new show on ABC called Shifting Gears. As the actor recently stated, he’s “geeked” about getting a third chance at a sitcom.  So, with that in mind, I’m not sure Patricia Richardson or Jonathan Taylor Thomas will be getting official calls from ABC or their former co-star in regards to a Home Improvement reboot. Nevertheless, based on Richardson’s comments, she’s fine with the OG show standing on its own, and Thomas wants to get into directing. Hopefully, both get the opportunities they desire, as their former scene partner gets his. All the while, you can still stream all eight seasons of the classic ‘90s sitcom using a Disney+ subscription.

Furkan Korkmaz,Furkan Korkmaz Says He Was Attacked by Georgian Players After EuroBasket Game,https://www.insider.com/furkan-korkmaz-says-attacked-by-georgian-players-after-eurobasket-game-2022-9,"A heated game between Georgia and Turkey in a EuroBasket tournament allegedly got ugly afterward. Turkish forward Furkan Korkmaz, who also plays for the Philadelphia 76ers, said that after getting ejected from a game, he was attacked by Georgian players and security members while heading back to the locker room. Korkmaz received two technical fouls and was ejected after a confrontation with Georgia's Duda Sanadze. Afterward, Korkmaz told reporters that he got into a ""street fight,"" as he was ambushed by three Georgian players and security guards. ""As soon as we walked out of the tunnel and were trying to reach the locker room, I saw three Georgian players alongside two security guys running at us. We started throwing punches at each other,"" Korkmaz said, via BasketNews. ""That's basically what happened. ""It was like a street fight. There was no talk or conversation. People just came at us and were trying to attack us."" Ismail Senol of BeIN Sports Turkey reported that the three Georgian players were Sanadze, Tornike Shengelia, and Goga Bitazde, who also plays on the Indiana Pacers.

                               Turkish head coach Ergin Ataman also described the situation similarly, via EuroHoops: ""There were no security measures whatsoever when I was going at locker room,"" Ataman said. ""When we were going there, three players from them, including Sanadze, as well as two security guys, started to run at us. We started throwing punches at each other. Basically, it was a street fight. Five people attacked us, we defended ourselves. ""It was such a scramble. There were players from Georgia. The intention of the security guys was not good. They did not try to intervene in the events."" Sanadze, however, said accounts of what happened in the locker room had been exaggerated. ""It wasn't like that,"" Sanadze said, via BasketNews. ""My teammates were simply following me to the locker room. There were a couple of words said from him and from us. Then we met each other, but the security was trying to be between us. Even if we tried to fight, we couldn't [have done] it because there were people between us. ""It was a kind of a brawl. I don't think anyone punched or slapped each other. There were some swings going on, but I don't think anyone got injured."" Turkish basketball federation vice president Omer Onan told EuroHoops that the team would withdraw from the tournament if they didn't get security footage of the altercation. Turkey bounced back to beat Belgium on Sunday, 78-63, with Korkmaz scoring 16 points.
